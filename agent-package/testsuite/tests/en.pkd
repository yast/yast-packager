Description:
NetBSD's ash (Almquist sh) for Linux is a small (62K - no job control) Bourne-compatible shell. Great for machines with low memory, but does not provide all the extras of shells like bash, tcsh, and zsh. Most shell scripts are run compatible to bash. Note that most scripts written for Linux use some bash-specific syntax. The Slackware setup scripts are a notable exception, since ash is the shell used during installation.

## -----> bc <-----

Filename:      bc.rpm
Label:         GNU command line calculator
Notify:
Yfiton:
Delnotify:
Yfitonled:
Description:
bc is an interpreter that supports numbers of arbitrary precision and the interactive execution of statements. There are some similarities in the syntax to the C programming language. A standard math library is available through command line options. When used, the math library is read in before any other input files. bc then reads in all other files from the command line, evaluating their contents. Then, bc reads from standard input (usually the keyboard). 
The dc program is also included. Dc is a calculator which supports reverse-polish notation and allows unlimited precision arithmetic. Macros can also be defined. Normally, dc reads from standard in but can also read in files specified on the command line. A calculator with reverse-polish notation saves numbers to a stack. Arguments to mathematical operations (operands) are "pushed" onto the stack until the next operator is read in which "pops" its arguments off the stack and "pushes" its results back onto the stack.

Yfitonled:
Description:
This is GNU cpio, a program to manage archives of files. This package also includes mt, a tape drive control program. Cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive. An archive is a file that contains other files plus information about them, such as their pathname, owner, timestamps, and access permissions. 
The archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe. 
This package normally also includes the program "rmt", which provides remote tape drive control. Since there is a compatible 'rmt' in the 'dump' package we didn't put 'rmt' into this package. If you are planning to use the remote tape features provided by cpio you have to install the 'dump' package as well.

Description:
This package enables the usage of PCMCIA hardware with Linux. The handling and configuration is described in the manual in chapter 11. More detailed documentation can be found under /usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/ and in some included manpages. (See "rpm -ql pcmcia | grep man" after installation.) 
The PCMCIA modules strongly depend on the running kernel. Therefore the modules are packed with the kernel in the packages k_*.rpm. If you compile your own kernel you should recompile the pcmcia package as well. For this install the pcmcia source package from the zq series. After rebooting with the new kernel just call rpm -ba /usr/src/packages/SPEC/pcmcia.spec and install the new packages. 
The program cardinfo is placed in the package pcmcia-cardinfo. 
Note that you need this package even if you use the intergrated pcmcia support of kernel 2.4. Only Cardbus cards are managed from the kernels hotplug system. 
Supported hardware: Most modern PCMCIA chipsets and cards are supported. A list of supported chipsets can be found in the PCMCIA-HOWTO under /usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/. In the same directory you can find a file SUPPORTED.CARDS. We have integrated additional drivers in the PCMCIA package. See the README.<driver> files for documentation. README.contrib contains a short summary of these additional drivers.

This version of syslogd is similar to the standard Berkeley product, but with a number of compatible extensions.  The klogd daemon runs either independently or as a client of syslogd. 

Klogd 'listens' to kernel log messages, prioritizes them, and routes them to either output files or to syslogd.  This version of klogd will optionally translate kernel addresses to their symbolic equivalents if provided with a system map.

This package enables the usage of PCMCIA hardware with Linux. The handling and configuration is described in the manual in chapter 11. More detailed documentation can be found under /usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia-cardinfo/ and in some included manpages. (See "rpm -ql pcmcia-cardinfo | grep man" after installation.) 
The PCMCIA modules strongly depend on the running kernel. Therefore the modules are packed with the kernel in the packages k_*.rpm. If you compile your own kernel you should recompile the pcmcia-cardinfo package as well. For this install the pcmcia-cardinfo source package from the zq series. After rebooting with the new kernel just call rpm -ba /usr/src/packages/SPEC/pcmcia-cardinfo.spec and install the new packages. 
The program cardinfo is placed in the package pcmcia-cardinfo-cardinfo. 
Note that you need this package even if you use the intergrated pcmcia-cardinfo support of kernel 2.4. Only Cardbus cards are managed from the kernels hotplug system. 
Supported hardware: Most modern PCMCIA chipsets and cards are supported. A list of supported chipsets can be found in the PCMCIA-HOWTO under /usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia-cardinfo/. In the same directory you can find a file SUPPORTED.CARDS. We have integrated additional drivers in the PCMCIA package. See the README.<driver> files for documentation. README.contrib contains a short summary of these additional drivers.

Hotplugging is a new feature of Linux, with the goal of letting you plug in new devices and use them immediately. That means that users won't need to learn as much system administration. Systems will at least partially be autoconfiguring themselves. Initially, it includes support for USB and PCI (Cardbus) devices, and can automatically configure network interfaces. 
Now that basic USB and Cardbus hotplugging seems to behave properly, upcoming work will likely involve integration with other Linux subsystems such as input, pcmcia_cs, 1394, disk/storage (starting with SCSI), networking, printing, power management such as APM and ACPI, and more. Kernel 2.5 work will improve autoconfiguration support for Linux, likely including more unified support for stable device names and user mode device management tools.

-full support of termcap/terminfo (useful for device independent description to control screen output). -optimizing screen refresh even as GNU Emacs (Joe can even be used at 2400 baud). -easy installation. All features for UNIX integration of the VI: a marked block of text can be filtered through a UNIX command; and wherever JOE accepts a filename parameter the following can also be substituted: 
!command		:to redirect from/to another command 
>>filename		:to append onto an existing file 
filename,start,size	:to edit a part of a file/device 
-			:to use standard input/output 
When JOE has several files opened at the same time, each file is displayed in its own window. Additionally, JOE allows for shell-windows whereby the output of the executed commands are saved in a buffer, automatic filename completion (via TAB), help windows, undo-redo, search and replace using regular expressions.

The Midnight Commander is a Norton Commander clone; a program that manipulates and manages files and directories. It is useful, fast, and has color displays on the Linux console. It also has mouse support if you run the "gpm" mouse server.  This program requires the terminal description files in /usr/lib/terminfo, which are found in ncurses.rpm (the essential ones) or terminfo.rpm (the rest). 
You can also use the Midnight Commander under X with your mouse. If you enter "mc -c",  colors will be used. 
In Midnight Commander, the screen is divided into four sections, whereby the majority of the screen is covered by two directory panels. The second to last line on the screen is the shell command line; the last line displays the function key assignments. At the very top, the menu list is shown. One of the directories displayed is the current working directory. This is where most of the commands are found. For certain commands, like copy and move, the second directory is used as the target directory.

Description:
Scsh is a broad-spectrum systems-programming environment for Unix embedded in R4RS Scheme. 

Scsh has a high-level process notation for doing shell-script-like tasks: running programs, establishing pipelines, and I/O redirection. For example, the shell pipeline 

gunzip < paper.tex.gz | detex | spell | lpr -Ppulp & 

would be written in scsh as 

(& (| (gunzip) (detex) (spell) (lpr -Ppulp))	; Background a pipeline (< paper.tex.gz))				; with this redirection 

Scsh embeds this process notation within a full Scheme implementation. The process notation is realized as a set of macro definitions and is carefully designed to allow full integration with standard Scheme code. Scsh isn't Scheme-like, it is Scheme.

From Overview.html: 

When editing HTML it's easy to make mistakes. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a simple way to fix these mistakes automatically and tidy up sloppy editing into nicely layed out markup? Well now there is! Dave Raggett's HTML TIDY is a free utility for doing just that. It also works great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized HTML editors and conversion tools, and can help you identify where you need to pay further attention on making your pages more accessible to people with disabilities. 

Tidy is able to fix up a wide range of problems and to bring to your attention things that you need to work on yourself. Each item found is listed with the line number and column so that you can see where the problem lies in your markup. Tidy won't generate a cleaned up version when there are problems that it can't be sure of how to handle. These are logged as "errors" rather than "warnings". 

Tidy features in a recent article on XHTML by webreview.com.

Description:
SQL is the most popular database language in the world. MySQL is a client/server implementation that consists of a server daemon mysqld and many different client programs and libraries. 
The main goals of MySQL are speed, robustness and ease of use. MySQL was originally developed because the developers at TcX needed a SQL server that could handle very large databases an order of magnitude faster than what any database vendor could offer to them. They have now been using MySQL since 1996 in an environment with more than 40 databases containing 10,000 tables, of which more than 500 have more than 7 million rows. This is about 100 gigabytes of mission-critical data. 
The base upon which MySQL is built is a set of routines that have been used in a highly demanding production environment for many years. While MySQL is still in development, it already offers a rich and highly useful function set. 
The official way to pronounce MySQL is "My Ess Que Ell" (Not MY-SEQUEL).

Description:
DBMS (DataBase Management System) PostgreSQL is the successor of the relational database system INGRES. It has been developed at Berkeley, University of California. 
The main advantages of the new system are: 
- better support of complex objects; 
- improved user-side adaption of data types, operators and access methods; 
- integration of active databases (alerts and triggers), conclusions including forward and backward chaining; 
- simplification of dbms code for restore after a crash. 
- provision of a design which concatenates the advantages of optical disks and workstations which consist of many compound processors and customer-specific VLSI chips; 
- avoidance of too many changes according to relational model. 
The query language for this system is SQL. This system offers you a wide range of additional features such as transparent history-system, embedding in your own C-routines, shell scripts and more.

* scsiformat: A low-level formatting tool for SCSI disks. 
* scsidev: If your SCSI config changes from time to time, for example, because you have external devices which are not always switched on or connected, the kernel's mapping to the device nodes is not always the way you would expect it. This program creates a mapping which remains unchanged in most of these cases. 
* rescan-scsi-bus.sh: Script that scans the SCSI bus and dynamically adds and, optionally, removes devices. 
* sg_utils: A collection of small useful tools based on the sg interface that give info on the SCSI bus, copy data,... 
Warning: Some of these tools access the internals of your system and misuse of them may render your system inoperational. 
Note: scsiinfo comes with a graphical user interface which can be found in the xscsi package.

Sqsh is much more than a nice prompt (a la 'dsql', from David B. Joyner). It is intended to provide much of the functionality provided by a good shell, such as variables, aliasing, redirection, pipes, backgrounding, job control, history, command substitution, and dynamic configuration. Also, as a by-product of the design, it is remarkably easy to extend and add functionality.

Partition Surprise is a GPL'ed partition managing software for Linux. Partition resizes, moves, and conversions are implemented. Limited support of operations on mounted ext2 file systems is included as well. 
RPM created for beta testing phase! Backup your data before using! Generally, the safest use of this program is to run it as a regular user with access to the testing physical disk (like /dev/hdc*) in /dev. The partition table will not be reread automatically if modifications by Surprise "confirm" were made by a regular user. All debug messages (currently turned on during compilation) are sent to stderr (e.g., "surprisecurses 2>/tmp/surlog" or "surprisecurses 2>/dev/null"). 
You should use either "surprisecmdline" client or more comfortable "surprisecurses" one. These clients are designed for further use. Just for testing purposes, a YaST2-destined "dummy" module is provided, "testdummy" client (/usr/surprise/tests/testdummy). Read its documentation file "testdummy.txt".

The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore, and a number of other utilities for administering XFS file systems. 

xfsdump examines files in a file system, determines which need to be backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or other storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the dump of an XFS file system and also knows how to backup XFS extended attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can thus be transferred between Linux machines of different architectures and also between IRIX machines. 

xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump.  It can restore a full backup of a file system.  Subsequent incremental backups can then be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

A set of commands to use the XFS file system, including mkfs.xfs. 

XFS is a high performance journaling file system which originated on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multithreaded, can support large files and large file systems, extended attributes, variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance and scalability. 

Refer to the documentation at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/ for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible with the IRIX version of XFS.

The ANTS Load Balancing System is a piece of software that will allow jobs to be executed on computers connected in a network (eg. a Beowulf). The node best suited (at the time of execution) for the job given, will be chosen to execute the job. This is an approach different from that of traditional Queue systems. A job is not queued, it is executed immediately if any suitable host (for the given job type) can be found. This makes the system suitable for execution of a large number of small jobs, such as compilers. A traditional queue system will often take up too much time managing it's queues, to allow tasks such as large-scale compilations to gain much speedup using it.

NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that encapsulates the best of ttcp and netperf and visually represents the network performance under a variety of conditions. By taking the end-to-end application view of a network, NetPIPE clearly shows the overhead associated with different protocol layers. Netpipe answers such questions as: how soon will a given data block of size k arrive at its destination? Which network and protocol will transmit size k blocks the fastest? What is a given network's effective maximum throughput and saturation level?  Does there exist a block size k for which the throughput is maximized? How much communication overhead is due to the network communication protocol layer(s)? How quickly will a small (< 1 kbyte) control message arrive, and which network and protocol are best for this purpose?

User programs written in C, C++ or Fortran access PVM through library routines. 
After installation you find in /usr/share/doc/packages/pvm/ the documentation as PostScript file pvm-book.ps.  Furthermore some examples are packed together in two tar archives.  Those archives should be extracted into your HOME directory which leads to ~/pvm3/examples/ or ~/pvm3/gexamples/ in your HOME directory.  The call `aimk all' (see manual page aimk(1)) e.g. in ~/pvm3/examples/ compiles the examples for the PVM system.

XMPI is an X/Motif based graphical user interface for running, debugging and visualizing MPI programs. Extensive MPI information is extracted from a running application on demand or from a cumulative log of communication. Both sources are tightly integrated with an application overview window and any number of single process focus windows. 
XMPI can acquire and display extensive detail on an application's MPI communication, including the following: o process synchronization status: running, system, or blocked o message queue contents o source, destination, root ranks o MPI function name o communicator o data type o message count o tag The above information is acquired from on-demand snapshots of application status using debugging hooks in the MPI implementation or from a trace log of communication activity. 
XMPI is a great tool for teaching MPI in a hands-on setting.  Students run example code and can see and verify each MPI operation.  XMPI has an application "wizard" to help assemble programs and assign processors to MIMD and SPMD applications.  Furthermore, it is not tedious to generate, acquire, and display information.  A typical development cycle begins by assembling an application and continues in the following manner. o press the snapshot button to see what's going on now o pop-up focus windows for a few interesting processes o press the snapshot button a few (or a few dozen!) more times o see the application completed, hung, deadlocked, etc... o press the trace button once and the timeline window is displayed o review the previous execution with trace log snapshots o make application changes and press the rerun button No recompiles or special libraries are required to snapshot the application or obtain a trace log.

It provides the functionality to manipulate, write it out, read in from a file, and synchronized it with the contents of a file for a tree structure of strings, data blocks, arrays and dictionaries (key-value pair lists). PropList is used by WindowMaker and related Projects. Includes, etc. are in the libPropListd package.

This package contains two libraries, libg++ and libstdc++, and their respective headers. 
Libg++ is the original C++ class library of the GNU project and came into life long before thre C++ library was standardised. Because of this it should not be used for new projects. It's only included for older packages that might need it. 
Libstdc++ ist the current C++ library of the GNU C++ compiler. While it is much closer to the standard, it is far from being complete. 
You will find the source code in the package gcc, series zq.

Memory efficiency: Small integers and short floats are immediate, not heap allocated. Automatic, non-interruptive garbage collection.  Speed efficiency: Assembly language kernel for some CPUs, Karatsuba and Schoenhage-Strassen multiplication.  Interoperability: Garbage collection with no burden on the main application, hooks for memory allocation and exceptions. 
The following C++ features are used: classes, member functions, overloading of functions and operators, constructors and destructors, inline, const, multiple inheritance, templates and namespaces.  The following C++ features are not used: new, delete, virtual inheritance, exceptions.

Description:
Cilk is a language for multithreaded parallel programming based on ANSI C. Cilk is designed for general-purpose parallel programming, but it is especially effective for exploiting dynamic, highly asynchronous parallelism, which can be difficult to write in data-parallel or message-passing style. Cilk provides an effective platform for programming dense and sparse numerical algorithms, such as matrix factorization and N-body simulations, and we are working on other types of applications. Unlike many other multithreaded programming systems, Cilk is algorithmic, in that the runtime system employs a scheduler that allows the performance of programs to be estimated accurately based on abstract complexity measures.

clisp 

The documentation of CLISP is placed in the directories 
/usr/share/doc/packages/clisp/

As well as the conventional CLISP, the package also includes CLX, an extension of CLISP for the X Window System. Of course X11 has to be installed before the command 
clx 
is called. The description of this CLX version (new-clx) is placed in

The new Cocoon paradigm is based on the fact that document content, style and logic are often created by different individuals or working groups. Cocoon aims for a complete separation of the three layers, allowing the three layers to be independently designed, created and managed, reducing management overhead, increasing work reuse and reducing time to market.

Description:
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising compiler for Haskell 98, GHC compiles Haskell to either native code or C.  It implements numerous experimental language extensions to Haskell 98; for example: concurrency, a foreign language interface, multi-parameter type classes, scoped type variables, existential and universal quantification, unboxed types, exceptions, weak pointers, and so on.  GHC comes with a generational garbage collector, and a space and time profiler. 

GHC is directed at two main groups of users: 

Application writers. We think that Haskell is a great language to write applications in, and are dead keen for GHC to be used for this purpose. To this end we have worked hard on GHC's external interfaces: particularly the ability to call and exchange data with foreign languages and components (see HaskellDirect).  (If you are interested, here's a list of some real-world applications of functional languages.) 

Implementors. GHC is specifically designed to act as a "motherboard" into which others can "plug in" their own strictness analyser, profiler, front end, back end, or other special pass. Learning enough about GHC to do this is a fairly substantial exercise, but it's a lot quicker than writing the whole system yourself. Even more important, it means that there's enough scaffolding to really stress your gizmo against real programs (the NoFib suite provides some...), rather than toy ones. 

This release contains Manuel M. T. Chakravarty's <chak@is.tsukuba.ac.jp> 62-tuple patch.

GNATS is a bug-tracking tool designed for use at a central support site. Software users who experience problems use electronic mail to communicate these problems to the the maintainers of that software; GNATS partially automates the tracking of these problems by: 
· organizing problem reports into a database and notifying responsible parties of suspected bugs; 
· allowing support personnel and their managers to edit, query and report on accumulated bugs; and 
· providing a reliable archive of problems with a given program and a history of the life of the program by preserving its reported problems and their subsequent solutions. 
GNATS offers many of the same features offered by more generic databases.  You can query and edit existing problem reports (PRs) as well as obtain reports on groups of PRs.  The database itself is simply an ordered repository for problem reports; each PR receives a unique, incremental PRnumber, which identifies it throughout its lifetime.

Hugs is a Haskell interpreter and programming environment for developing cool Haskell programs.

In addition, it comes packaged with the libraries defined in the most recent version of the Haskell Library Report and with extension libraries which are compatible with GHC 3.0 and later. 
Hugs is best used as a Haskell program development system: it boasts extremely fast compilation, supports incremental compilation, and has the convenience of an interactive interpreter (within which one can move from module to module to test different portions of a program). However, being an interpreter, it does not nearly match the run-time performance of, for example, GHC or HBC.

If development changed the protocol and made it incompatible with previous versions only the libraw1394 has to be upgraded to match the kernel version (instead of all applications).

Description:
GNU Smalltalk is an implementation which is almost Smalltalk-80 conform (\tm ParkPlace Systems) as described in Adele Goldberg and David Robson's book 'Smalltalk-80: the Language and its Implementations', which will be referred to as the 'Blue Book'. 
Smalltalk is an object oriented programming language, meaning that the programmer not only has to keep the data in his head but the operations which can be applied to this object. The ability of an object of keeping not only track of the data but also to those operations that are connected to itself are inseparable glued together. The amount of actions that can be performed by the object is precisely defined by the amount of operations of this special object (called methods in Smalltalk). You can't 'see' the contents of an object from outside the object. Seen from the outside an object is a black box which has some particular operations and states, but that's about all you know. 
In Smalltalk everything is an object. This includes variables, executable procedures (methods) and stack frames (context of invoked methods or context of a block). Every object is an instance of a class. You can see a class as a datatype and its incorporated functions. An instance is a particular variable of this datatype. 
If you want to perform an operation on one of these objects you have to send it a message and the object reacts by performing the correspondent action. To print something, e.g., you could send the message like this: 
someObject print 
The message you send is indeed the name of a method (procedure) which should be carried out. If you send a message to an object Smalltalk tries to find out the method that has been defined for this kind of object. First it starts looking at the objects class. If there is no such class it bothers the parent class, in the grandfather class etc.. At the top of this class-construction there is a class called Object which has no ancestors.  If Smalltalk couldn't find a method until then it produces an error code. 
For a complete explanation of Smalltalk there is a very nice tutorial by Andy Valencia: try the command   info '(gst)Tutorial' . 
Additionally the X Smalltalk interface and object browser 'blox' (xgst) is included.  Besides blox, GNU Smalltalk has two other modules which may be compiled in, tcp and gdbm.  All three available modules are compiled to the executable named gst_all; if you need another combination of modules, recompile the source (or write to feedback@suse.de). 
Happy small talking!

Yfitonled:
Description:
This package allows MS-DOS programs to be started in Linux. A virtual machine (the DOS box) provides the necessary BIOS functions and emulates most of the chip devices (e.g. timer, interrupt- and keyboard controler). 
Documentation can be found in '/usr/share/doc/packages/dosemu' and in the man page, as well as in the sources. 
Starting with version 1.0.2 DOSEMU configuration files are no longer below /etc but in the user's HOME directory below ~/dosemu. DOSEMU does no longer have the SUID bit set, so if you need access to hardware that requires root privileges, you must run DOSEMU as 'root'. 
If you rely on the old configuration scheme, you can get it back by using 'dosemu.bin' instead of 'dosemu' ('dos' and 'xdos' have been renamed to 'dosemu' resp. 'xdosemu'). 
The parameter $_hogthreshold in '~/dosemu/conf/dosemu.conf' defines how often an 'idling' DOSEMU should return the CPU to Linux and its default value '(1)' means 'all power to Linux'. The higher this value is, the more more CPU power is dedicated to DOSEMU. The value '(0)' disables this feature completely, hence: 'all power to DOSEMU'. If that isn't fast enough, you (running UID root) can get maximum performance with 
nice -19 dos -D-a 2>/dev/null 
Don't be surprised though if the other Linux processes then run very sluggishly. 
On sensitive systems you _never_ should offer a suid-root DOSEMU world readable, because even if the '$_secure' option in dosemu.conf is set, its not avoidable that some DPMI-clients (most likely Dos4gw based ones) may succeed in accessing the whole user space (including DOSEMU code) and thus gain root access. A comfortable solution is to have two copies of the DOSEMU binary, a non-suid-root one for world access and a suid-root one (protected by file permissions) only available to trusted users.

Mame is an arcade machine emulator able to emulate more than 1300 different machines. Started in 1997 by Nicola Salmoria, Mame started out as a series of emulators for individual games. This series was combined into a multiple game emulator format. In its current form, mame is no longer a one man show; there are over 100 contributors to the project. 
To use Mame, you need images of the arcade machine ROMs which you can find, e.g., on the Internet. Please note that possession of these images is usually only legal if you also posess the actual arcade machine circuit board. 
Put the zip-archived ROMs in the directory /usr/games/lib/xmame/roms. Start Mame as "xmame.x11 <name of game>" (X11 version) or "xmame.svgalib <name of game>" (SVGALib version).

When an object accelerates past a few million meters per second, these effects begin to grow noticeable, becoming more and more pronounced as the speed of light is approached. These relativistic effects are viewpoint-dependent, and include shifts in length, object hue, brightness and shape. 
The moving object is, by default, a geometric lattice. 3D Studio and LightWave 3D objects may be imported as well. Best of all, the simulator is completely interactive, rendering the exotic distortions in real-time!

GNU Data Access (GDA) is an attempt to provide uniform access to different kinds of data sources (databases, information servers, mail spools, etc.). It is a complete architecture that provides all you need to access your data. It is defined by a set of CORBA interfaces as generic as possible (but very powerful at the same time) so that any kind of data source can be accessed through them.

From the README: 
---------------- 

gnotepad++ is an easy-to-use, yet fairly feature-rich, simple text editor for Unix based systems running X11 and using GTK (the Gimp ToolKit) or GNOME.  gnotepad++ was designed to have as little bloat as possible, while still providing many of the common features found in a modern GUI-based text editor.  It is still fairly light-weight, especially for the features it offers, and aims to remain that way. 

The "+" in gnotepad++ is there to differentiate it from other GTK-based text editors which may call themselves "gnotepad+".  Additionally, gnotepad++ is not intended to be fancy, so it leverages its text editing capabilities on the GTK Text Widget.  Hence, if you are looking for a programmers's editor, look for another text editor or help improve the GTK Text Widget. 

Features 
-------- 

- Multiple windows, multiple documents 
- Complete preferences system (no need to edit any config files) 
- Recent document menu 
- Popup Document list 
- Popup Window list 
- Popup Messages box 
- Menu accelerators that work 
- Document autosave 
- Document backup before saving 
- HTML viewing using the gtk-xmhtml widget 
- Save window size and position 
- File locking using fcntl() or flock() 
- GNOME support 
- Other configurable options: toolbars, document tabs, etc. 
- Fairly clean code that's actually commented/documented!

From the README file: 
Gnumeric is still a young program and it is advancing steadily. 

This is a partial list of Features implemented in Gnumeric, we need documentation for these: 

- Autofill Number autofill (computes delta, autofills from that) String autofill (daynames, months are built in). String+Number combo integer autofill Formula autofill. 

- Drag and drop selection. Select an area and use the border to drag the contents (shift/control/alt are modifiers to copy or move) 

- Selection - Multiple selection is supported, hold down control key to augment the existing selection (it might be discotinuous). 
- Walking selection Use return/tab and shift-return/shift-tab to capture information in a selection. 
- Fill quickly a region with the same text: just enter the text in a selection and press control-enter. 

- Number formatting - The formatting of numbers is very powerful, we do emulate the Excel number formatting specification. 
- Format rules: you can use rules to specify which format to use 
- Format colors: you can specify a color to format with in the format. 

- Column/Row resizing - Drag the column/row division to adjust the column and row dimenssions. 
- To make changes to various columns/rows simultaneously, select the columns and then change the dimension of one of them. 

- To edit the contents of a cell that already has a value, press F2 key. 

- When typing a formula, you can use the cursor keys to select a cell or a cell range in the expression.  This will only work if a cell name is valid at the cursor point. 
To specify a cell range, just move to the start of the cell range and then hold down the shift key while making the size of the selection cursor bigger. 

- An expression is evaluated constantly on top of the current selection.  There is a number of pre-defined auto-compute expressions, you can change this by right clicking on this expression (it is on the bottom right corner) 

- If you drag a selection with button 3 instead of button one there is no default action, rather, a menu pops up with a list of possible actions to perform. 

- Gnumeric distinguishes regular text from formulas by preceding formulas with an equal sign.  So to enter an expression you have to enter for example: =1+2. 

- Control-Space selects a column 
- Control-A selects all 
- SHift-Space selects the row. 
- Selection-keys + control extend the selection to boundary of worksheet. 
- SHift-Backspace:  Collapses selection to active cell. 
- Home: move to the beginning of the row. 
- Control-Home: move to the cell A1

Description:
Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing "real-world" scenes (most of the time there are pictures that have been scanned-in with a scanner). Cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit. You should note that the output of JPEG is not necessarily the same as its input. If this is a factor for you, then don't use it. With typical real-world scenes, JPEG can achieve high compression rates, without noticeable differences. If you can accept pictures of lower quality, JPEG can achieve amazingly high compression rates. 
There are some library functions available for reading and writing JPEG files. The 'cjpeg' and 'djpeg' applications use the library to make conversions between JPEG and other popular graphics file formats possible. The library is meant to be used within other applications. 
Cjpeg compresses the input file, or standard input if no filename was given, and produces a JPEG/JFIF to standard output. Currently supported input file formats include: PPM (PBMPLUS color format), PGM (PBMPLUS Grayscale format), BMP, GIF, Targa and RLE (Utah Raster Toolkit Format). (RLE is only supported if the RLE library is available.) Djpeg decompresses a JPEG file in one of the above mentioned formats.

Description:
This is Magick++, the object-oriented C++ API to the ImageMagick image-processing library. 
Magick++ supports an object model which is inspired by PerlMagick. Magick++ should be a bit faster than PerlMagick since it is written in a compiled language which is not parsed at run-time. This makes it suitable for Web CGI programs. Images support implicit reference counting so that copy constructors and assignment incur almost no cost. The cost of actually copying an image (if necessary) is done just before modification and this copy is managed automatically by Magick++. De-referenced copies are automatically deleted. The image objects support value (rather than pointer)  semantics so it is trivial to support multiple generations of an image in memory at one time.

he 'Open Type Organizer' project provides programs to list and modify tables in OpenType font files, specifically, their 'name' and 'cmap' tables.  It can be used to translate 'name' and 'cmap' of OpenType font in locale encodings to Unicode encoding so the font file can be used in an environment which does not understand locale encodings.  The translated tables are added to the font while keeping the original tables intact. 
Do you have a True Type font which does not work with Xft (e.g. with KDE and Antialiasing)? Chances are, the font doesn't have a Unicode 'cmap'!  Open Type Organizer (oTo) will help to solve the problem.  It will add Unicode 'name' and Unicode 'cmap' tables by translating the original ones.  Your favorite ttf font can really work for you now.

Ray tracing is not a fast process by any means, (the generation of a complex image can take several hours) but it produces very high quality images with realistic reflections, shading, perspective, and other effects.

SGML-Tools is a text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which allows you to produce LaTeX, HTML, GNU info, LyX, RTF, and plain ASCII (via groff) from a single source. This system is tailored for writing technical software documentation, an example of which are the Linux HOWTO documents. It should be useful for all kinds of printed and online documentation. This package is considered as the successor of the Linuxdoc package. SGML-Tools is not able to process arbitrary SGML documents; in such a case, give jade_dsl a try and write your own DSSSL scripts (take the docbk30 package as an example).

This project has been under way since early 1991, beginning with the small original file included with the MOKE (Mark's Own Kanji Editor) Japanese word-processing package. It reached a size of nearly 103,000 entries when it was split into two files: EDICT containing the "normal" dictionary entries, and ENAMDICT containing names. Both files are used by a number of software packages and thousands of users world-wide. The EDICT file is now over 60,000 entries and the ENAMDICT file over 160,000. 

Meanwhile there are also some additional dictionary files for special purposes, for example COMPDIC for words from the computing and communication field.

FreeWnn is a Kana-Kanji translation system, originally developed by a joint project formed by Kyoto University, OMRON Corporation [formerly known as Tateishi Electronics Co.], and ASTEC Inc. Further developement and maintenance is now done by the "FreeWnn Project" (http://www.freewnn.org). 

The name "Wnn", is an acronym for the Japanese sentence "Watashino Namaeha Nakanodesu" (literally, it means "my name is Nakano."), is derived from a goal of the project: to develop a system powerful enough to translate a whole sentence like that at once.  The source code has been written in C, and was distributed freely. Consequently, Wnn spread widely among workstation platforms, and became a de-facto standard as a Kana-Kanji translation system for UNIX operation systems. 

Wnn works in client-server manner. The server portion of Wnn, or jserver, is used as a Kana-Kanji translation engine for clients like "xwnmo" and "kinput2" (input systems for the X Window System), or for clients like "Egg", which is part of Mule (=Multi lingual Emacs) and XEmacs. 

This package contains only the Japanese server.

KanjiPad is a very simple program for handwriting recognition - The user draws a character into the box, then requests translation. The best candidates are displayed along the right hand side of the window and can be selected for pasting into other programs. 
It is meant primarily for dictionary purposes for learners of Japanese - it does not support entering kana, so its usefulness as an input method is limited. Furthermore, if you already know the reading of a character, conventional pronunciation based methods of entering the character are probably faster. 
However, KanjiPad is sometimes useful for entering very unusual characters, even if the pronunciation is known, because pronunciation based input methods often fail for rarely used characters.

More functionalities are expected to merge into the library in the future. 

A practical application of libtabe is an intelligent phonetic input method interface, bims. bims accepts input in BoPoMoFo and generates output to meaningful sentence. 

The bimsphone module of XCIN-2.5 is based on libtabe/bims directly, and in the future more modules might be also based on it.

Unicode Input Server (uinput) is a keyboard input converter to enter multilinugal text with a common alphabetical keyboard.  It translates a sequence of ASCII characters into a unicode character, then sends the unicode character to an appropriate X client (application program). Such clients need to support uinput protocol on their GUI toolkit library level.  Uinput support patch for Qt library version 2 is also available by the author.  (See http://www.kde.gr.jp/patch/.) (These patches are already in qt-japanese.rpm). 
Uinput currently provides French, German, Russian, and Greek typing rules and can happily coexist with an XIM input method like kinput2 for Japanese text.

Description:
This package contains an init script for the Japanese Input server WXG. It does *not* contain the server itself. 

WXG is a Kana-Kanji conversion server using the Canna communication protocol. WXG is compatible to NEC's Kana-Kanji conversion server &quot;Canna&quot; and can therefore be talk to Canna clients like kinput2, canuum, Mule, and XEmacs. It can be used as a direct replacement for Canna. 

However, WXG uses the same port as Canna and can therefore not run concurrently with Canna, you can run either WXG or Canna, not both at the same time. 

To get more information about the WXG input server, please have a look at http://www.ekotoba.com. If you agree to the license you can download the WXG server from that page.

By now, kscan provides an object KScanDevice, which allows to open and connect to a locally installed scanner. The Object can cope with the scanner capabilities and provides easy to use methods to deal with the scan options. Furthermore, a widget factory is provided, which returns ready to use widgets for scanner capabilities to insert in a programs GUI.

The start/stop scripts are prepared to access the UART emulation (so called `SIR' mode) with 115 kbit/s data transfer rate. This is supported by the most notebooks with infrared interface. 
After starting the infrared protocol manager `irmanger' with the command `rcirda start' you can send data to your printer by using the device file /dev/irlpt0. If you like to talk to other computers with infrared interface or to a mobile phone you can use the serial emulation provided by the device file /dev/ircomm0. 
Please take a look at the README file located in /usr/share/doc/packages/irda/README and into the IRDA HOWTO which is located in /usr/share/doc/howto/en/IR-HOWTO.gz. If the infrared port on your notebook is located on a different IO or IRQ address then IO address 0x2f8 (/dev/ttyS1) or interrupt 3 you should use yast to change the variables IRDA_PORT and IRDA_IRQ in the configuration file /etc/rc.config.

The LPRng software is an enhanced, extended, and portable implementation of the Berkeley LPR print spooler functionality.

LPRng provides emulation packages for the SVR4 lp and lpstat programs, eliminating the need for another print spooler package. These emulation packages can be modified according to local requirements, in order to support vintage printing systems. 
Attention: Interoperability with older LPD implementations requires privileged access to ports.  Therefore all affected client-programs ship with SUID root priviledges!

Description:
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides client accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs and up to a few tens of milliseconds on WANs relative to a primary server synchronized to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) via a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example. Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and diverse network paths, to achieve high accuracy and reliability. Some configurations include cryptographic authentication to prevent accidental or malicious protocol attacks. 
ntpd is an operating system daemon which sets and maintains the system time-of-day synchronized with Internet standard time servers. ntpd is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. ntpd does most computations in 64-bit floating point arithmetic and does relatively clumsy 64-bit fixed point operations only when necessary to preserve the ultimate precision, about 232 picoseconds. While the ultimate precision is not achievable with ordinary workstations and networks of today, it may be required with future nanosecond CPU clocks and gigabit LANs. 
The daemon can operate in any of several modes, including symmetrical active/passive, client/server broadcast/multicast, and manycast. A broadcast/multicast or manycast client can discover remote servers, compute server-client propagation delay correction factors, and configure itself automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without specifying configuration details specific to the local environment. 
Ordinarily, ntpd reads the ntp.conf configuration file at start-up time to determine the synchronization sources and operating modes. It is also possible to specify a working, although limited, configuration entirely on the command line, obviating the need for a configuration file. This may be particularly appropriate when the local host is to be configured as a broadcast/multicast client or manycast client, with all peers being determined by listening to broadcasts at run time. 
Various internal ntpd variables can be displayed and configuration options altered while the daemon is running using the ntpq and ntpdc utility programs.

Description:
The Apache HTTP server. Very few programs have spread so quickly and attracted such a large following in such a short time as this HTTP server.  According to Netcraft, Apache runs on about 49.05%% of all servers attached to the Internet. That represents about 1,182,142 systems. It has replaced within only a few months the NCSA server which, until then was the unchallenged favorite.  This is undoubtedly because Apache was derived from the NCSA server sources and that its configuration is compatible to that of NCSA/1.3. 

The Apache project was established to provide a forum for the development of a freely available HTTP server. The goal is to develop a secure, efficient, and easily extendable server, which also closely parallels the development of the HTTP protocol. Thus Apache became a replacement to NCSA/1.3. 

Besides better performance, the removal of known errors, and better conformance to HTTP standards (HTTP/1.1), Apache offers the following useful features, which are often missing in other servers: 

* password files, used to protect documents from unauthorized access, can be indexed in various ways. The search for an entry is as a result more efficient than in ordinary text files. 

* client-request errors can be responded to in a flexible manner. CGI scripts can be used to analyze the error and generate more informative replies to both the client and the administrator than the HTTP status codes offer. 

* there is no restriction on aliasing and redirection. The Alias and Redirect directives can be used in arbitrary number and depth. 

* Apache can choose the best representation of a resource based on the browser-supplied preferences for media type, languages, character set and encoding ("Content Negotiation"). 

* with Apache you can implement several virtual servers. Thus requests to different IP addresses (referring to the same computer) can be distinguished and, depending on the IP address, appropriately handled. 

Further advantages are the module concept and the well-documented API (Application Programmers Interface). Extensions are easily developed and new features are easily integrated into the server. For example, an implementation of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) from Netscape exists for Apache. This permits secure communication between server and client. 
Apache is installed in the following directories: 
/etc/httpd                      -> configuration files 
/usr/sbin/httpd                 -> server binary 
/var/log/httpd/                 -> protocol files 
/var/run/httpd.pid              -> server PID

What is mod_backhand? 

mod_backhand is project that allows seamless redirection of HTTP requests from one web server to another. This redirection can be used to target machines with under-utilized resources, thus providing fine-grained, per-request load balancing of web requests. 

Backhand is a project that was initiated in class at The Johns Hopkins University in The Department of Computer Science. After a simple proof of concept, written in C++, the project was pursued as a graduate qualifier project. 

A proof of concept was realized, but a deployable product was needed. In order for public use, testing and, ultimately, acceptance, we wished to provide drop-in functionality in the most popular web server on the net. 

mod_backhand was born. This drop-in module for the Apache Web Server provides a turnkey solution for intra-cluster redirection of HTTP on a per-request basis. The redirection is based on various system resources available within the cluster. This service is provided seamlessly, preserving remote host information for access/authentication purposes. As with the methodology of Apache, the redirection mechanism can be enabled or disable for individual directories. 

System resources are announced by the module to the cluster via ethernet broadcasts and/or IP multicasts. These resources are made available to the decision making algorithms that drive mod_backhand.

Description:
This is a C program to do "bulk" mailing.  For input, it takes a file of recipient addresses (one address per line) and a message (with headers already attached) to be sent to the recipients.  It sorts the recipient list by reversed domain (so similar ones sort together), splits up the recipients into several groups containing no more than N domains each, creates an SMTP envelope for each group of recipients, and feeds that envelope to "/usr/lib/sendmail -bs". 

Splitting the envelopes up allows sendmail to perform delivery in parallel, so instead of having one large queue entry (for which sendmail might take awhile to get around to attempting delivery for some recipients), it has several smaller queue entries.  Depending on your point-of-view, this can still be considered "cluttering up your mail queue", but it does seem to deliver messages more quickly to most recipients. 

The core of this program was extracted from a somewhat strange mailing list manager called na-net; it was designed to efficiently send out mail to 5000 people at a time.  I have used this program to attempt delivery of a message to over 12000 recipients around the world, within a few hours.  I'm currently using bulk_mailer as a back-end for several mailing lists of modest size. 

However, the program is not extensively tested, and may not work well in all environments.  (In particular, if your system has per-user process quotas, or a small number of process table entries, you will want to modify this program to recover gracefully.) 

There's no warranty on this, but you're welcome to use it if you want.

fping is a ping-like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is responding. fping differs from ping in a way that you can specify any number of targets on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping. Instead of sending pings to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion. 
In the default mode, if a target replies, it is noted and removed from the list of targets to check; if a target does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry limit it is designated as unreachable. fping also supports sending a specified number of pings to a target, or looping indefinitely (as in ping ). 
Unlike ping, fping is meant to be used in scripts, so its output is designed to be easy to parse.

Description:
The response to the first packet sent through a demand dial ppp link is usually lost, especially with dynamic IP assignment, but also if dialin takes longer time. The upper layers recover from such loss only after a noticable delay. ip_resend eliminates such delays by resending the first packet with adjusted ip-addresses as  soon as the link becomes operational.

Description:
Mod_python allows embedding Python within the Apache http server for a considerable boost in performance and added flexibility in designing web based applications. 

Apache processes requests in stages (e.g. read the request, parse headers, check access, etc.). These stages can be implemented by functions called handlers. Traditionally, handlers are written in C and compiled into Apache modules. Mod_python provides a way to extend Apache functionality by writing Apache handlers in Python. For a detailed description of the Apache request processing process, see the Apache API Notes. 

For most programmers, the request and the authentication handlers provide everything required. To ease migration from CGI and Httpdapy, two handlers are provided that simulate these environments allowing a user to run his scripts under mod_python with (for the most part) no changes to the code. 

Mod_python originates from a project called Httpdapy. For a long time Httpdapy was not called mod_python because Httpdapy was not meant to be Apache-specific. Httpdapy was designed to be cross-platform and in fact was initially written for the Netscape server.

rinetd redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another. rinetd is a single-process server which handles any number of connections to the address or port pairs specified in the file /etc/rinetd.conf. Because rinetd runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to redirect a large number of connections without a severe impact on the machine. This makes it practical to run TCP services on machines inside an IP masquerading firewall. 

Note: rinetd can not redirect FTP, because FTP requires more than one socket.

rsync uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for bringing remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand. At first glance, this may seem impossible because the calculation of diffs between two files normally requires local access to both files. 
A technical report describing the rsync algorithm is included with this package.

Samba is a suite of programs which work together to allow clients to access Unix filespace and printers via the SMB protocol (Server Message Block). 
In practice, this means that you can redirect disks and printers to Unix disks and printers from LAN Manager clients, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 clients, Windows'95 clients, Windows NT clients and OS/2 clients. There is also a Unix client program supplied as part of the suite which allows Unix users to use an ftp-like interface to access filespace and printers on any other SMB server. 
Samba includes the following programs (in summary): 
* smbd, the SMB server. This handles actual connections from clients. 
* nmbd, the Netbios name server, which helps clients locate servers. 
* smbclient, the Unix-hosted client program. 
* smbrun, a little 'glue' program to help the server run external programs. 
* testprns, a program to test server access to printers. 
* testparm, a program to test the Samba configuration file for correctness. 
* smb.conf, the Samba configuration file. 
* smbprint, a sample script to allow a Unix host to use smbclient to print to an SMB server. 
The suite is supplied with full source and is GPLed. 
This package expects its config file under /etc/samba/smb.conf.

It supports: 

* integrated phone book 
* sending faxes directly from the phone book 
* setting up job parameters before sending a job and during processing of the job in the job queue 
* removing jobs from the job queue 
* direct viewing of received faxes (needs an external tiffg3 viewer or converter. For Linux and UNIX, the converting is done by fax2ps from libtiff and viewing by ghostview or gv automatically by a script included with this package) 
* creating of serial fax lists out of the phone book entries 
* automatic cover page generation (not very fast) 
* auto-spooling (important for Windows users) This program is also running on WINDOWS and hopefully all the other platforms that support Java by the JDK from Sun. It has been tested on WindowsNT 4.0 and it seems to run. 
* password prompting if the administrator of the fax server wants the users to access the server via password 
* JDBC Support

AOLserver is a World Wide Web server that provides access control and database connections and runs on multiple UNIX platforms. AOLserver can access SQL databases including Sybase, SOLID, Postgres, and some third-party database drivers. AOLserver is extendable with both C and Tcl APIs that expose core functions and provide primitives for accessing the database. AOLserver also provides optional CGI support, although the C and Tcl APIs are more powerful, offer superior performance, and are easier to use. You can configure multiple servers within one AOLserver configuration file, and then specify which server to run when you run AOLserver. AOLserver also uses a multi-threaded design on all supported platforms. You can configure the number of threads each server can use. AOLserver offers direct connections to SQL databases such as SOLID and Postgres, plus an external database connection to Sybase. Third-party database drivers are provided for Oracle, Informix, and Interbase. You can even configure AOLserver to have connections to multiple databases and specify which databases are available to each server. AOLserver also includes server administration capabilities. An access control system allows you to specify separate permissions for each combination of URL and HTTP method (GET, PUT, or POST). You can also specify users and groups who are allowed access to AOLserver.

It includes a number of new features over 9.1, including: - The size of the cache can now be limited using the "max-cache-size" option. - The server can now automatically convert RFC1886-style recursive lookup  requests into RFC2874-style lookups, when enabled using the new option  "allow-v6-synthesis". This allows stub resolvers that support AAAA records  but not A6 record chains or binary labels to perform lookups in domains  that make use of these IPv6 DNS features. - Performance has been improved. - The named.conf parser has been completely rewritten. It now supports "include" directives in more places such as inside "view" statements, and it no longer has any reserved words. - The "rndc status" command is now implemented. rndc can now be configured automatically. - A BIND 8 compatible stub resolver library is now included in lib/bind. - OpenSSL has been removed from the distribution. This means that to use DNSSEC, OpenSSL must be installed and the --with-openssl option must be supplied to configure. This does not apply to the use of TSIG, which does not require OpenSSL.

o Maintaining software for a cluster of equally configured workstations centrally. o A low-cost X-terminal. o A low cost user platform where remote partitions are mounted by NFS and you are willing to accept the slowness of data transfers that results from NFS, compared to a local disk. o Various kinds of remote servers, e.g. a tape drive server that can be accessed with the RMT protocol. o Routers. o Machines doing tasks in environments unfriendly to disks.

If EXIF information is embedded in the image (shutter speed, aperture, focal length, etc.), it will be displayed. 
It will create thumbnail images for JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF images. It can be configured to display icons for any other type of file. 
IDS uses HTML template sets called "themes." This allows you and, optionally, your visitors to change the look of your site on the fly. You can create your own themes.

Description:
MajorCool is a CGI script written in Perl that provides a Web interface to Majordomo v1.9x*. It is intended to run co-located with the Majordomo program (ie, both list-server and Web on the same host). Employing a variety of Web/GUI techniques such as Balloon Help, Per-User Preferences, and MouseOver cues, MajorCool puts a friendly face on top of the Majordomo list management processes. 
"If you run a Majordomo service, go get MajorCool!" -- Mark Rauterkus, E-Marketing Digest 
MajorCool was originally designed as an administrative front-end to the popular mailing list manager, allowing novice list-owners to manage their list configuration and subscriber base. With the easy-to-use password protected screens, list managers can: 
-    Edit the list config file. Presentation of the complex list configuration file is simplified through the intuitive use of HTML radio buttons and text fields. 
-    Update the subscriber file via an easy-to-use text window. Changes to the list are converted to the appropriate individual approved subscribe and unsubscribe commands. 
-    Manage the moderator's Approval Queue, deleting, rejecting, or approving BOUNCE messages that require review. No more messing with mail headers! 
-    Edit files in the Approval Queue prior to action. Limited only by browser memory constraints. 
-    Create or edit the list's info and intro files. 
-    Download the list configuration file via e-mail. 
In addition to its list administration functions, MajorCool also provides a site-oriented view of the list-server's lists. MajorCool extends the address matching capabilities of Majordomo through the use of configurable siteaddr modules, permitting external directory sources such as X.500 to supply name-to-address conversions and provide pattern-matching address comparisons. These features enable MajorCool to identify list subscribers by multiple valid addresses, allowing end-users to interactively: 
-    View lists available on the server: All lists on the system. Unsubscribed lists. Subscribed lists (regardless of the address used for subscription). Lists with names or descriptions that match a certain pattern. 
-    Subscribe or unsubscribe to any list. 
-    View the list's info or intro files. 
-    View members of a list. 
Lastly, MajorCool provides a mailing list request mechanism, allowing end-users to ask that a list be created, renamed, or deleted. This request can be mailed to the Majordomo owner, or passed to an external program to perform whatever actions are desired. (Sample applications are provided to implement list creation, renaming, and/or deletion on-the-fly.) 
-- 
To configure MajorCool change to /usr/lib/majorcool and run "sh ./Configure". This script will prompt for some installation values and save the output to a default.sh file. This file can be edited at any time. 
For more details see "/usr/lib/majorcool/Docs/install.htm".

DjVuLibre is an open source (GPL'ed) implementation of DjVu, including viewers, browser plugins, decoders, simple encoders, and utilities. DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF, JPEG, and GIF for distributing scanned documents, digital documents, or high-resolution pictures. DjVu content downloads faster, displays and renders faster, looks nicer on a screen, and consume less client resources than competing formats. DjVu images display instantly and can be smoothly zoomed and panned with no lengthy re-rendering. DjVu is used by hundreds of academic, commercial, governmental, and non-commercial web sites around the world.

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for numerical computing. The routines are written from scratch by the GSL team in ANSI C, and present a modern Applications Programming Interface (API) for C programmers, while allowing wrappers to be written for very high level languages. 
The library covers the following areas, 
Complex Numbers           Roots of Polynomials   Special Functions      Vectors and Matrices      Permutations           Sorting                BLAS Support              Linear Algebra         Eigensystems           Fast Fourier Transforms   Quadrature             Random Numbers         Quasi-Random Sequences    Random Distributions   Statistics             Histograms                N-Tuples               Monte Carlo            Integration            Simulated Annealing       Differential Equations Interpolation          Numerical Differentiation Chebyshev              Series Acceleration    Approximation                                 Discrete Hankel           Root-Finding           Minimization           Transforms                                                              Least-Squares Fitting     Physical Constants     IEEE Floating-Point

This is a developing project to monitor a large assortment of UPS hardware. Many models have ports on the back to allow other devices to check their status.  If it gives basic information about the power and battery status, it can probably be supported without too much difficulty.  More advanced features on the higher-end models are also supported to allow tracking of values over time such as temperature and voltage. 
Network communications are used so that multiple systems can monitor a single physical UPS and shut down together if necessary without any special "sharing hardware" on the UPS itself. Detailed information about supported hardware can be found in /usr/share/doc/packages/smartups/README

The individual computers may be shared- or local-memory multiprocessors, vector supercomputers, specialized graphics engines, or scalar workstations, that may be interconnected by a variety of networks, such as ethernet, FDDI.  User programs written in C, C++ or Fortran access PVM through library routines. 
After installation you find in /usr/share/doc/packages/pvm/ the documentation as PostScript file pvm-book.ps.  Furthermore some examples are packed together in two tar archives.  Those archives should be extracted into your HOME directory which leads to ~/pvm3/examples/ or ~/pvm3/gexamples/ in your HOME directory.  The call `aimk all' (see manual page aimk(1)) e.g. in ~/pvm3/examples/ compiles the examples for the PVM system.

It supports merging several GIFs into a GIF animation; exploding an animation into its component frames; changing individual frames in an animation; turning interlacing on and off; adding transparency; adding delays, disposals, and looping to animations; adding or removing comments; flipping and rotation; optimizing animations for space; and changing images' colormaps, among other things. Extensive command-line options control which, if any, of these occur. 
Gifview, a companion program requiring X11, displays GIF images and animations on an X display. It can display multi-frame GIFs either as slideshows, displaying one frame at a time, or as real-time animations. 
Gifdiff, another companion program, checks two GIF files for identical visual appearance. This is probably most useful for testing GIF-manipulating software.

Description:
CORSO is an open middleware framework that supports any kind of platform and reduces complexity in distributed and heterogeneous systems (e.g. front end under NT/Visual Basic, back end on a LINUX cluster, implemented in C/C++). 
CORSO provides the abstraction of a virtual shared memory (VSM), where a/synchronous and reliable communication is carried out via the access to shared data objects. CORSO allows to reliably model business processes that collaborate via the shared object space because both communication and process coordination are supported by CORSO in a transactional and secure way. 
Located between the distributed application program and the operating systems, CORSO makes programming in a distributed environment as easy as writing a program for one single computer: CORSO offers highest availability and performance by replicating data objects intelligently to those sites where they are needed. 
CORSO consists of a lean runtime system and a library for VSM. For fast and efficient software development of parallel and robust applications in heterogeneous environments (LINUX/UNIX, NT), CORSO can be integrated with all relevant standards and provides language bindings for C/C++, Java, Visual Basic, and Oracle Forms (others can be added easily). 
Commercial usage is prohibited. No liability is taken by TECCO. For further information please visit www.tecco.at or mail to info@tecco.at. 
This package contains: Coordination Kernel, Console, User Configuration Tool, Administration Tool, Monitoring Tool, C&Co-language binding and extensive documentation. 
This version is limited to 2000 objects and a runtime of 24 hours. If one of those conditions is reached the CORSO Kernel terminates and has to be restarted.

SpyKer enables system and application developers to visualize the execution of tasks, user events, and kernel events over time.  This capability allows developers to find application bugs that are difficult to locate and provides developers information that can be used to tune the performance of their system or application.  It can be used to solve network, database or embedded system problems.  A major differentiator of SpyKer is that it does not require a pre-instrumented kernel.  The SpyKer trace driver dynamically inserts trace points at run-time and saves trace data to memory or files.  A capture screen allows users to configure buffer size and location with start and stop point selection.  SpyKer uses a Java(tm) based GUI to display trace data in different colors to highlight events.  Info, zoom, search, measure tools are provided to analyze captured data. Contact Lynuxworks at http://www.lynuxworks.com/suse_spyker_eval to receive a demo license key or purchase this innovative trace tool.

International Program License Agreement 

Part 1 - General Terms 
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE PROGRAM. IBM WILL LICENSE THE PROGRAM TO YOU ONLY IF YOU FIRST ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED PROGRAM TO THE PARTY (EITHER IBM OR ITS RESELLER) FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO RECEIVE A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. 
The Program is owned by International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries (IBM) or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold. 
The term "Program" means the original program and all whole or partial copies of it. A Program consists of machine- readable instructions, its components, data, audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and related licensed materials. 
This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms, and "License Information" and is the complete agreement regarding the use of this Program, and replaces any prior oral or written communications between you and IBM. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify those of Part 1. 

1. License 
Use of the Program 
IBM grants you a nonexclusive license to use the Program. 
You may 1) use the Program to the extent of authorizations you have acquired and 2) make and install copies to support the level of use authorized, providing you reproduce the copyright notice and any other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program. 
If you acquire this Program as a program upgrade, your authorization to use the Program from which you upgraded is terminated. 
You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program does so only in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 
You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program. 
Transfer of Rights and Obligations 
You may transfer all your license rights and obligations under a Proof of Entitlement for the Program to another party by transferring the Proof of Entitlement and a copy of this Agreement and all documentation. The transfer of your license rights and obligations terminates your authorization to use the Program under the Proof of Entitlement. 

2. Proof of Entitlement 
The Proof of Entitlement for this Program is evidence of your authorization to use this Program and of your eligibility for warranty services, future upgrade program prices (if announced), and potential special or promotional opportunities. 

3. Charges and Taxes 
IBM defines use for the Program for charging purposes and specifies it in the Proof of Entitlement. Charges are based on extent of use authorized. If you wish to increase the extent of use, notify IBM or its reseller and pay any applicable charges. IBM does not give refunds or credits for charges already due or paid. 
If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on IBM's net income, upon the Program supplied by IBM under this Agreement, then you agree to pay that amount as IBM specifies or supply exemption documentation. 

4. Limited Warranty 
IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified operating environment it will conform to its specifications. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program or that we will correct all Program defects. You are responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program. The warranty period for the Program expires when its Program services are no longer available. The License Information specifies the duration of Program services. 
During the warranty period warranty service is provided without charge for the unmodified portion of the Program through defect-related Program services. Program services are available for at least one year following the Program's general availability. Therefore, the duration of warranty service depends on when you obtain your license. If the Program does not function as warranted during the first year after you obtain your license and IBM is unable to resolve the problem by providing a correction, restriction, or bypass, you may return the Program to the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom you acquired it and receive a refund in the amount you paid for it. To be eligible, you must have acquired the Program while Program services (regardless of the remaining duration) were available for it. 
THESE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
These warranties give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply to you. In that event such warranties are limited in duration to the warranty period. No warranties apply after that period. 

5. Limitation of Liability 
Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, you are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, regardless of the basis on which you may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the greater of U.S. $100,000 (or equivalent in your local currency) or the charges for the Program that is the subject of the claim. 
IBM WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR SAVINGS), EVEN IF IBM, OR ITS RESELLER, HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
IBM will not be liable for 1) loss of, or damage to, your records or data or 2) any damages claimed by you based on any third party claim. 
This limitation of liability also applies to any developer of a Program supplied to IBM. It is the maximum for which IBM and its suppliers are collectively responsible. 

6. General 
Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. 
IBM may terminate your license if you fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If IBM does so, your authorization to use the Program is also terminated. 
You agree to comply with applicable export laws and regulations. 
Neither you nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation. 
Neither you nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control. 
The laws of the country in which you acquire the Program govern this Agreement, except 1) in Australia, the laws of the State or Territory in which the transaction is performed govern this Agreement; 2) in Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Ukraine, and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the laws of Austria govern this Agreement; 3) in the United Kingdom, all disputes relating to this Agreement will be governed by English Law and will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts; 4) in Canada, the laws in the Province of Ontario govern this Agreement; and 5) in the United States and Puerto Rico, and People's Republic of China, the laws of the State of New York govern this Agreement.

Its unique transaction engine allows multiple backup and restore operations to be performed simutaneously with total reliabilty. This is especially valuable for multiple users backing up or restoring data on their own. (a multiple drive library is required). 
ARKEIA's Java interface enables the system administrator to manage multiple remote backup servers through internet as if they were local backups. 
ARKEIA is the most reliable software you can find. It has a powerful database capable of restoring sites to their original state, in the event of server disasters. 
ARKEIA integrates with all types of corporate environments and is available for UNIX or Windows NT servers. 
ARKEIA is the first software delivered with a JAVA interface, effectively neutralizing the problem of heterogeneous computer environments. Operators can use any Intranet station to access any remote network. Its universal interface makes it the first software able to backup via the Internet. 
ARKEIA is compatible with a wide range of devices and provides the best "plug and play" solution for effective data security.

Description:
FrontBase is a high performance SQL 92 compliant relational database engine developed by Frontline Software. 
http://www.frontline-software.com 
The basic package included here is called Bronze, and is free. The Bronze package is a fully networked version with the only constraints being that it comes with no support and that it doesn't include any security checks. The latter constrain meaning that if you have network access to the machine running a Bronze package of FrontBase, you can connect to and access all FrontBase databases running on that machine without further ado. There is no connection or user limit. 
Installation directories: 
/opt/FrontBase			-> program directory /etc/rc.d/FrontBase		-> start/stop Script /etc/rc.d/FBWeb			-> start/stop Script /usr/share/doc/packages/FrontBase	-> documentation

VShop is the simple, fast and efficient tool for eBusiness  applications on SuSE Linux. It offers a wide range of applications  from the simple shop to the complex hosting platform (ISP/ASP). 
With VShop you can set up retail shops (b2c), regional malls  (shopping malls)  as well as platforms for wholesale trade (b2b).  Over 1.900 installations have been made with VShop, including  BASF, Deutsche Bahn (German Railways), Deutschlandradio,   Kaufhor, Mannesman, Medion and SuSE. You will find more information at www.intradat.com. 
Version 3 of VShop is published with the source code. You will  find the latest update of the source code at www.vshop.org  together with a special Java based editor (VSLEdit) to work on the  VSL templates. 
VSL = VShop Language: The technology resembles PHP and it has in addition various e- commerce functions.   

You can download the driver for Adabas D and SAP DB databases  at www.vshop.org. 
Technical Information for VShop 3.0 and SuSE 7.3: 
After you have successfully installed VShop you can call the  components as follows  
*VSystem (generate KEY here): 
http://localhost/vsystem/ 
Account "admin", no password 
* VShop: 
http://localhost/vshop/ 
* VShop administration area 
http://localhost/vshop/admin/ Account "admin", no password 
To run VShop with a URL other than http://localhost/... you will first  have to generate a license key  (always free of charge for testing  and developing). 
You can either do it in VSystem under License Administration or at  http://services.intradat.com.   
You will find the database scripts for the installation of the various  databases (mySQL, Adabas D, SAP DB) at  /usr/local/vshop/database. 
The installation of VShop 3.0 under SuSE 7.3 requires that - mySQL has been installed - the administration account "root" has no password - no database "vshop" or "vsystem" has been created yet 
The installation for databases other than mySQL requires the  respective driver you will find at http://www.vshop.org. 
there you go!

Description:
In basic operation, each of the handlers Filter1, Filter2, and Filter3 will make a call to $r->filter_input(), which will return a filehandle.  For Filter1, the filehandle points to the requested file. For Filter2, the filehandle contains whatever Filter1 wrote to STDOUT. For Filter3, it contains whatever Filter3 wrote to STDOUT. The output of Filter3 goes directly to the browser. 

Note that the modules Filter1, Filter2, and Filter3 are listed in forward order, in contrast to the reverse-order listing of Apache::OutputChain. 

When you've got this module, you can use the same handler both as a stand-alone handler, and as an element in a chain. Just make sure that whenever you're chaining, all the handlers in the chain are "Filter- aware," i.e. they each call $r->filter_register() exactly once, before they start printing to STDOUT. There should be almost no overhead for doing this when there's only one element in the chain.

It's usage is transparent and should prove to be quite convenient (and hopefully, efficient).

It's possible to accidentally inherit an AUTOLOAD method. Often this will happen if a class somewhere in the chain uses AutoLoader or defines one of their own. This can lead to confusing error messages when method lookups fail. 
Sometimes you want to avoid this accidental inheritance.  In that case, inherit from Class::WhiteHole. All unhandled methods will produce normal Perl error messages.

Description:
This package consists of a C library and a Perl module (which uses the C library, internally) for all kinds of date calculations based on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in all western countries today), thereby complying with all relevant norms and standards: ISO/R 2015-1971, DIN 1355 and, to some extent, ISO 8601 (where applicable). 
(See also http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/Date-Calc/DIN1355/ for a scan of part of the "DIN 1355" document (in German)). 
The module of course handles year numbers of 2000 and above correctly ("Year 2000" or "Y2K" compliance) -- actually all year numbers from 1 to the largest positive integer representable on your system (which is at least 32767) can be dealt with. 
Note that this package EXTRAPOLATES the Gregorian calendar BACK until the year 1 A.D. -- even though the Gregorian calendar was only adopted in 1582 by most (not all) European countries, in obedience to the corresponding decree of catholic pope Gregor I in that year. 
Some (mainly protestant) countries continued to use the Julian calendar (used until then) until as late as the beginning of the 20th century. 
Finally, note that this package is not intended to do everything you could ever imagine automagically for you; it is rather intended to serve as a toolbox (in the best of UNIX spirit and traditions) which should, however, always get you where you want to go.

However, all of these comments, whitespace etc. are ignored by the browser, and needlessly lengthen download times. 

Second, many people are using WYSIWYG HTML editors these days. This makes creating content easy.  However these editors can cause a number of compatibility problems by tying themselves to a particular browser or operating system.

Delnotify:
Yfitonled:
Description:
This is the HTML::SimpleParse module.  It is a bare-bones HTML parser, similar to HTML::Parser, but with a couple important distinctions: 

First, HTML::Parser knows which tags can contain other tags, which start tags have corresponding end tags, which tags can exist only in the <HEAD> portion of the document, and so forth.  HTML::SimpleParse does not know any of these things.  It just finds tags and text in the HTML you give it, it does not care about the specific content of these tags (though it does distiguish between different _types_ of tags, such as comments, starting tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and so on). 

Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any attention to balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which pairs of tags are inside other pairs of tags. 

Because of these characteristics, you can make a very effective HTML filter by sub-classing HTML::SimpleParse.

Notify:
Yfiton:
Delnotify:
Yfitonled:
Description:
The SuSEfirewall can be used to make a host or a network more secure. You can control, which services should be reachable to the outside  world and thus reduce the exposure to be compromised by design flaws or vulnerabilities in the daemons that provide those services. 
For all experts out there: this is NOT a complete firewall setup but  a simple (no, not simple, it tries actually to be clever) packet filter. But people look for such functionality under the keyword firewall,  that's why this package is named like this. 
Note that there is a package personal-firewall which is meant to just block all incoming connections, which is normally what you want if you don't offer any services, e.g. because you use a dial-in internet connection. Use personal-firewall for such occasions. 
Also note that there is the new SuSEfirewall2 which uses the iptables functionality of the 2.4 kernels. (Note that you can use the old SuSE- firewall on 2.4 kernels as well.) It's not as well tested as the old ipchains based SuSEfirewall, of course, but offers some new possibilities due to the stateful design of the new iptables filtering mechanism.

Notify:
Yfiton:
Delnotify:
Yfitonled:
Description:
This package is the successor of the SuSEfirewall (firewals) package. Like SuSEfirewall, SuSEfirewall2 implements a packetfilter to allow system administrators to protect their computer and network by restricting the possibilities of other hosts to connect to them. This potentially saves you from suffering under the design flaws and vulnerabilties that are found from time to time in various daemons. 
Unlike the old ipchains based SuSEfirewall, this version uses the new iptables/netfilter packet filtering infrastructure that comes with 2.4 kernels. It allows even more flexible rule setup and, specifically, the creation of a stateful firewall, as it keeps track of connections and  has the notion of related connections. 
Note that for simply protecting a single host from attacks, you're probably best of using the personal-firewall that comes with SuSE Linux. 
Note that the old SuSEfirewall can also be run on 2.4 kernels, as there is support for the old ipchains based rules in 2.4. SuSEfirewall2 can coexist with SuSEfirewall. This may be useful for configurations, where you sometimes boot 2.2 and sometimes 2.4 kernels. The SuSEfirewall scripts will detect if SuSEfirewall2 is installed and enabled and if a 2.4 kernel is running and in such a case will just not start SuSEfirewall, resulting in SuSEfirewall2 to be active.

The SuSE personal-firewall is activated by the variable REJECT_ALL_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS in /etc/rc.config.d/security.rc.config. The variable can be set to either "no", "yes", "masq", or one or more interface names, seperated by spaces. The firewall script inserts firewall rules that should not interfere with any other rules/rulesets and therefore is fully compatible with the SuSEfirewall, working "on top" of the SuSEfirewall rules. The script runs each time /etc/ppp/ip-up or /etc/ppp/down is called to catch up with the changes in the nameserver configuration as performed by the ppp subsystem. 
NOTE: some protocols will fail if the personal-firewall is active. Among these are ftp (PORT mode), irc (DCC mode, CTCP), quake, real-audio, real-video and others that open secondary connections or that use UDP datagrams.

Description:
cryptlib is a powerful security toolkit which allows even inexperienced crypto programmers to easily add encryption and authentication services to their software. The high-level interface provides anyone with the ability to add strong security capabilities to an application in as little as half an hour, without needing to know any of the low-level details which make the encryption or authentication work. Because of this, cryptlib dramatically reduces the cost involved in adding security to new or existing applications. 
cryptlib provides a transparent and consistent interface to a number of widely-used security services and algorithms which are accessed through a straightforward, standardised interface with parameters such as the algorithm and key size being selectable by the user. Included as core components are implementations of the most popular encryption and authentication algorithms, Blowfish, CAST, DES, triple DES, IDEA, RC2, RC4, RC5, Safer, Safer-SK, and Skipjack conventional encryption, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-160 and SHA hash algorithms, HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA, HMAC-RIPEMD-160, and MDC-2 MAC algorithms, and Diffie-Hellman, DSA, Elgamal, and RSA public-key encryption. (IDEA and RC5 are not compiled for SuSE Linux!) 
On top of the basic encryption services, cryptlib provides an extensive range of high-level capabilities including full X.509 certificate handling with support for all X.509v3 and IETF PKIX certificate features as well as support for SET, Microsoft AuthentiCode, S/MIME, and SSL client and server certificates, handling of certification requests and CRL's including automated checking of certificates against CRL's, creation and processing of PKCS #7 certificate chains, and a full range of certification authority (CA) functions. Alongside the certificate handling, cryptlib provides a sophisticated key database interface which allows the use of a wide range of key database types ranging from PKCS #15 key files and PGP keyrings through to commercial-grade RDBMS's and LDAP directories with optional SSL protection. To complement its key management capabilities, cryptlib provides a complete S/MIME implementation with full-strength encryption, allowing email, files, and EDI transactions to be authenticated with digital signatures and encrypted in an industry-standard format. 
In addition to its built-in capabilities, cryptlib can make use of the crypto capabilities of a variety of external crypto devices such as hardware crypto accelerators, Fortezza cards, PKCS #11 devices, and crypto smart cards. The crypto device interface also provides a convenient general-purpose plug-in capability for adding new functionality which will be automatically used by cryptlib.

FreeS/WAN is an IPsec implementation which allows building Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). A typical VPN setup consists of two trusted networks, connected over an insecure network, typically the Internet. FreeS/WAN allows you to create an encrypted tunnel through the insecure area. Unlike CIPE, it is interoperable with other operating systems or even routers IPsec implementations. 
There is no longer support for the insecure DES algorithm. For interoperability your partner also needs to understand 3DES encryption. 
SuSE has added the X.509 support (http://www.strongsec.com/freeswan/) for you. 
It contains strong cryptographic routines. The US government does not allow to (re)export this software out of the US, regardless of where it has been written. Nowadays, you may register with the US authorities and may get granted a license to export it though. Some other countries (Russia, France, ...) may also have regulations preventing the import, export or usage of this piece of software.

Modules for GnuPG with licensing or security issues. Useful for interaction with PGP2, see end of file. Contains the gpg-2compat wrapper script from Gero Treuner, which allows the mixed use of RSA and DSA keys with GnuPG. Please read the following notes carefully! 
IDEA: Patented by Ascom Systec Ltd. of CH-5506 Maegenwil. Only freely usable for certain non-profit purpose: This software product contains the IDEA algorithm as described and claimed in US patent 5,214,703, EPO patent 0482154 (covering Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK), and Japanese patent application 508119/1991, "Device for the conversion of a digital block and use of same" (hereinafter referred to as "the algorithm").  Any use of the algorithm for commercial purposes is thus subject to a license from Ascom Systec Ltd. of CH-5506 Maegenwil (Switzerland), being the patentee and sole owner of all rights, including the trademark IDEA. 
RIJNDAEL: The winner of the NIST competition to find a new standard crypto algorithm (so, it's ths successor of DES). It's now included into GnuPG 1.0.4, so it's not included in here any more. 
RSA: This code should not have been exported _to_ the United States without a license agreement with PKP prior to Sept. 20, 2000, as it was encumbered by U.S. patent #4,405,829. The RSA support now went into GnuPG-1.0.3 and is therefore not in this package any more. 
RSAREF: This module is Copyright (c) 1999 Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@non-us.debian.org> and is placed into the public domain, do with it what you will. It comes with no warrenty express or implied. RSAREF is limited in key size and in the coding of the encrypted data. This module isn't terribly great as RSAREF has no concept of secure memory so the secret key and the symmetric cipher are written to insecure memory in several places in this code and within the RSAREF lib. NOT CURRENTLY BUILT. 
SKIPJACK: GPL -- but not recommended for use. 
3DES: An alternative 3DES implementation Requires Eric Young's SSLeay or the OpenSSL library. NOT CURRENTLY BUILT.

Description:
GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG easier for applications. It provides a high-level Crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification, and key management. Currently it uses GnuPG as its back-end, but the API isn't restricted to this engine. It is planned to add other back-ends to it. 
Who Should use GPGME? 
Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a complicated programming task, it is suggested that all software should try to use GPGME instead. This way bug fixes or improvements can be done at a central place and every applications benefits from this. Especially authors of MUAs should consider to use GPGME. It is even planned to created a set of standard widgets for common key selection tasks.

lsh however can be installed along with (open)ssh and supports fallback to a opensshd resp. sshd1 daemon for such connections. 
Docu can be found in /usr/share/doc/packages/lsh/ The startup of lshd is controlled by START_LSHD in rc.config.

A common shortcoming of programs is how they treat data and files in temporary or holding areas. Many people have been silently exploiting many of these problems for some time now. The tool opens the directory specified (defaults to /tmp) and continuously reads the contents. Upon first read, it spits out the list that it has built (it attempts an ls -l style output). From that point on, it shows any additions or deletions that it sees prefaced with '+' or '-' accordingly.

Expat is an XML 1.0 parser written in C. It aims to be fully conforming. It is currently not a validating XML processor. The current production version of expat can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip. The directory xmltok contains a low-level library for tokenizing XML. The interface is documented in xmltok/xmltok.h. The directory xmlparse contains an XML parser library which is built on top of the xmltok library. The interface is documented in xmlparse/xmlparse.h. The directory sample contains a simple example program using this interface; sample/build.bat is a batch file to build the example using Visual C++. The directory xmlwf contains the xmlwf application, which uses the xmlparse library. The arguments to xmlwf are one or more files which are each to be checked for well-formedness. An option -d dir can be specified; for each well-formed input file the corresponding canonical XML will be written to dir/f, where f is the filename (without any path) of the input file. A -x option will cause references to external general entities to be processed. A -s option will make documents that are not standalone cause an error (a document is considered standalone if either it is intrinsically standalone because it has no external subset and no references to parameter entities in the internal subset or it is declared as standalone in the XML declaration).

Apart from the general DTD, gf supports the HTML DTD used in the WWW project and Gary's Snafu DTD.  `gf' is not intended as a flexible system for hacking up a formatter for a random DTD, but as a usable document production system for a few DTDs.

The LT XML tool-kit includes stand-alone tools for a wide range of processing of well-formed XML documents, including searching and extracting, down-translation (e.g. report generation, formatting), tokenising and sorting. 

For special purposes beyond what the pre-constructed tools can achieve, extending their functionality and/or creating new tools is easy using the LT XML API. Minimal applications require less than one-half page of C code to express. 

LT XML provides two views of an XML file; one as a flat stream of markup elements and text; a second as a sequence of tree-structured XML elements. The two views can be mixed, allowing great flexibility in the manipulation of XML documents. It also includes a powerful, yet simple, querying language, which allows the user to quickly and easily select those parts of an XML document which are of interest.

From the RELNOTES: 

[...] a validating namespace-aware XML parser in C. 

RXP was written by Richard Tobin at the Language Technology Group, Human Communication Research Centre, University of Edinburgh. 

RXP is distributed under the GNU Public Licence, which is in the file COPYING.  RXP may be made available under other licensing terms; contact M.Moens@ed.ac.uk for details. 

RXP is based on the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation of 10th February 1998 and the Namespaces recommendation of 14th January 1999.  Deviations from these recommendations should probably be considered as bugs. 

There is currently only minimal documentation.  There is a manual page for the rxp program, and a hastily-written file called "Manual" which describes the public functions and data structures.  The file "Threads" contains some notes about use in a threaded environment. [...] 

A simple application (called rxp) is provided that parses and writes XML data, optionally expanding entities, defaulting attributes, and translating to a different output encoding. 

There is an RXP web page at 
http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/rxp.html 
Bug reports should be sent to richard@cogsci.ed.ac.uk.

Ecasound supports a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. Several open-source audio packages, like for instance ALSA, OSS, mpg123, lame, libaudiofile and MikMod, are directly supported. One of the advantages of ecasound's chain-based design is that effects can easily be combined both in series and in parallel. Oscillators and MIDI-CCs can be used for controlling effect parameters. Included user-interfaces are ecasound - a versatile console mode interface, qtecasound - a Qt-based X-interface and various command-line utils suitable for batch processing.

WorkBone is designed to easily play audio CDs in text-mode under Linux. WorkBone intentionally doesn't have all the features WorkMan has. It is intended for people who want to listen to their music with as little expense as possible. 
WorkBone uses the number block as a control panel to enable jumping from track to track, play CDs, stop, etc. Furthermore, the actual playing time is permanently actualized and displayed. 
WorkBone works with most CD-ROM drives. But there still are some NEC CD-ROMs that don't work because they use non-standardized audio commands which result in a malfunction of WorkBone. 
WorkBone  expects  to find the device: /dev/cdrom . If you don't have this device, change to /dev and soft link  your current CD-ROM device to 'cdrom'.

Squeak is an open, highly-portable Smalltalk-80 implementation whose virtual machine is written entirely in Smalltalk, making it easy to debug, analyze, and change. To achieve practical performance, a translator produces an equivalent C program whose performance is comparable to commercial Smalltalks. 
Other noteworthy aspects of Squeak include * real-time sound and music synthesis written entirely in Smalltalk * extensions of BitBlt to handle color of any depth and anti-aliased image rotation and scaling * network access support that allows simple construction of servers and other useful facilities * it runs bit-identical on many platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix, and others) * a compact object format that typically requires only a single word of overhead per object * a simple yet efficient incremental garbage collector for 32-bit direct pointers * efficient bulk-mutation of objects 
FOR FIRSTTIMERS: Create working directory where you want store the Squeak's image and run 'inisqueak' from there.

Description:
Attention! This package is useful only on machines at Deutschherrnstrasse. 
All that has to be done is to create a directory /abuild This may be a symlink (e.g. to /tmp or /var/tmp). A subdirectory Autobuild is created within this directory. The partition that contains this directory at least 100MB of disk space have to be free. There are several packages that need more space but don't care, the build will simply stop if a disk space limit should be exceeded. 
In case of someone decides not to take part (sometimes a machine is needed for working), then a simple 
touch /tmp/noautobuild 
is sufficient to prohibit abuild from building any package on that machine.  As soon as the current package has been finished autobuild will leave the machine alone for at least 6 hours. 
If there should run some extensively long job (e.g. XFree86is beeing built) root is able to stop the build by 
rcabuild stop 
After that a 
touch /tmp/noautobuild rcabuild start 
will give the machine 6 hours of peace.

This is a SuSE internal package. It contains the development environment for Oracle 8i Release 2 (8.1.6). It can be used to create SuSE packages with support for Oracle, but this package itself can NOT be distributed externally. Note that binary rpms created with Oracle support will very likely have a dependency on at least one Oracle library: libclntsh.so. You have to remove this dependency from our packages. It is save to do that because there is no oracle rpm anywhere that could provide this library, i.e. Oracle will always have to be supported outside of rpm.

Description:
TkDesk is a graphical desktop and file manager for UNIX (especially Linux) and the X Window System.  Compared with other file managers available, it offers the most complete set of file operations and services, plus gives the user the ability to configure most aspects of TkDesk in a powerful way.  The reason for this is the use of Tcl/Tk as the configuration and (for the greatest part of TkDesk) implementation language.  TkDesk has been influenced by various other systems and file managers: NeXT, for laying out the file browser windows, Apple Finder, for the idea of file annotations and, (shock horror), Windows 95, for some other (of course minor and unimportant ;-)) inspirations. 
This is a brief overview of the most prominent features of TkDesk: 
o  Arbitrary number of automatically refreshed file browsers and file list windows o  Configurable file-specific pop-up menus o  Drag and drop o  Files and directories may also be dropped onto the root window o  Configurable application bar, with several displays and cascadable pop-up menus for each button. Files can also be dropped here. o  History of visited directories, opened files, executed commands, and others, which is automatically saved to disk o  Find files through their annotation, name, contents, size, or age o  Trash can for safe deletion of files and directories o  Calculation of disk usage for directory hierarchies o  All file operations (find, copy, disk usage, etc.) are carried out in the background o  Traversal of directory hierarchies through recursive cascaded menus o  Bookmarks, create menu entries for often used files and directories o  Comprehensive hypertext online help o  Built-in multibuffer and undo-capable editor o  Close coupling with Netscape and XEmacs o  Sound support o  Powerful configuration of nearly all aspect of TkDesk through Tcl/Tk, this also allows the Tcl-literate to extend TkDesk in arbitrary ways o  Free of charge! But see the file COPYING, or menu entry Help/License for information on usage and redistribution of TkDesk

PassiveTeX is a library of TeX macros which can be used to process an XML document which results from an XSL transformation to formatting objects. 

PassiveTeX provides a rapid development environment for experimenting with XSL FO, using a reliable pre-existing formatter 

Running PassiveTeX with the pdfTeX variant of TeX generates high-quality PDF files in a single operation. 

PassiveTeX shows how TeX can remain the formatter of choice for XML, while hiding the details of its operation from the user.

In extended mode, several new primitives are added that facilitate (among other things) bidirectional typesetting. 
The formats are often prefixed with an 'e', hence eTeX as the extended version of TeX and eLaTeX as the extended version of LateX.  However, eplain is an exception to this rule.

Description:
After installing teTeX and the package te_latex, find a large selection of documentation for TeX, LaTeX, and various layout styles under /usr/share/texmf/doc. 
TeX (pronounced tech) is an interpreter for text formatting and was developed by Donald E. Knuth.  It works with control and macro commands on a text file. Working with TeX is similar to typesetting methods. LaTeX or better LaTeX2e is a complex macro package which  removes the cryptical TeX interface and does most of the work for the user. 
TeX uses special fonts produced by the MetaFont program. Various printer drivers and an X11 viewer is also included in this package. The teTeX package is based on the standard  TeX package of Karl Berry which makes configuration much easier. It's also possible to use PostScript fonts. A real PostScript printer is required however. If the ghostscript (gs) package is installed, all drivers for printing and viewing can use these fonts. Note,  however, that the fonts included in the ghostscript package are not identical to Adobe's PostScript fonts. The copyright  prohibits us from including them on the CD. 
Besides these features, there are the programs MakeIndex (for producing indexes), BibTeX (for literature data-processing), and the script xtexsh (requires tcl/tk). 
Note the differences between LaTeX2.09 and LaTeX2e. LaTeX2e can process original LaTeX2.09 text, but style files that require LaTeX2.09 internal macros may not work correctly.  Under /usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/base/, find the documentation for LaTeX2e.  New users should review the documentation stored there. 
The teTeX package from Thomas Esser includes a full texmf tree, many programs (tex, dvips, ...), shell scripts configuration, and a big collection of documentations. This package is simply configured by the script texconfig and has multilanguage options. 
Do NOT install this package together with ntex! 
teTeX is NOT an upgrade or update for the ntex package!!

Description:
The Open Inventor 3d Toolkit is an object-oriented toolkit that simplifies and abstracts the task of writing graphics programming  into  a  set  of  easy to use objects.  These objects range from low level data-centered objects such as Sphere,  Camera, Material, Light, and Group, to high level application-level objects such as Walkthrough  Viewer  and Material  Editor.   The  foundation concept in Inventor is the "scene database" which defines the objects to be  used in an application.  When using Inventor, a programmer cre­ ates, edits, and composes these objects into  hierarchical 3d  scene graphs (i.e., database).  A variety of fundamen­ tal application tasks such as  rendering,  picking,  event handling, and file reading/writing are built-in operations of all objects in the database  and  thus  are  simple  to invoke.

OpenUniverse is an OpenGL Solar System simulator. It will let you visit the Sun, the nine planets and a few major satellites with four different camera modes. Although it's not 100% accurate, planets' positions in a given date are within a range of the real positions. 
From www.openuniverseverse.org: Strictly spoken it's a piece of software, simulating the Solar System's bodies in 3D on your Windows or Linux PC (will work in most *NIX's as well). In difference to quite a few other programs it does so in realtime. Meaning you can view all the planets, moons and spaceships move along their paths, trace them, follow them, orbit them and even control them (time and spaceship contol). And you won't have to fight your way through hordes of green, slimey and one-eyed aliens for that ;-)

Lavaps is an interactive process-tracking program like ``top'', but with a much different attitude. Rather than presenting lots of specific info in digital form, it tries to present certain important information in a graphical analog form.  The idea is that you can run it in the background and get a rough idea of what's happening to your system without devoting much concentration to the task.

These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion, and call tips. The selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and background colors, and multiple fonts. It comes with complete source code and may be used in any free project or commercial product.

Description:
Nice simulator of neural networks which has been developed at the University of Stuttgart. All parameters are presented in individual windows. To really use this program, a fundamental background in neural networks is required. 
SNNS (Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator) is a software simulator for neural networks on Unix workstations developed at the University of Stuttgart. The aim of the project is the development of an flexible simulation interface for research and use of neural networks. 
SNNS consists mainly of two parts: 
o simulator kernel written in C 
o GUI under X11 
The simulator kernel works with the internal network-data structures of the neural network and performs all operations by learning or doing. It can also be used separately as a C program embedded in applications. It supports multiple network topologies and, almost like RCS, supports the sites concept. SNNS can be extended by the individual user with user-specific activation functions, output functions, site-functions, and learning procedures which can easily be connected as simple C programs with the simulation kernel. 
At the moment of this writing, the following algorithms are supported: 
o back propagation 
o vanilla (online) BP 
o BP with Momentum Term and Flat Spot Elimination 
o Batch BP 
o Time Delay BP 
o Counter propagation 
o Quick prop 
o Back percolation 1 
o Generalized radial-base-functions (RBF) 
o RProp 
o ART 1 
o ART 2 
o ARTMAP 
o Cascade Correlation 
o Return Cascade Correlation 
o Dynamic LVQ 
o Back propagation through time (for recursive networks) 
o Batch Back propagation through time (for recursive networks) 
o Quick propagation through time 	"    "        " 
o Kohonen Feature Maps 
The GUI XGUI based on the kernel presents 1/2/3-dimensional views of the neural network and controls the kernel during the run time of the simulation. Additionally, the 2D user-interface provides an integrated network-editor, which can be used to design, manipulate, and present neural networks. 
A complete user manual can be found in the package snnsdoc. 
The current version of SNNS can be obtained from ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de /pub/SNNS

x3270 is an IBM 3270 terminal emulator for the X Window System.  x3270 runs over a TELNET connection (with or without TN3270E) and emulates either an IBM 3279 (color) or 3278 (monochrome).  It supports APL2 characters, IND$FILE file transfer, NVT mode, a pop-up keypad for 3270-specific keys, alternative keymaps, 3287 printer sessions, a scrollbar and has extensive debugging and scripting facilities. 
c3270 is the curses-based version of x3270.  It runs on any dumb terminal (e.g. xterm, console), and supports (almost) all of the features of x3270.  c3270 scripts are compatible with x3270 scripts, and the subset of command-line options and resource definitions are compatible as well. 
s3270 is a scripting-only version of x3270.  This program is intended primarily for writing "screen-scraping" applications, e.g., a CGI back-end script that retrieves database information from a mainframe. 
tcl3270 is a Tcl-based 3270 scripting engine.  It lets you write Tcl scripts that manipulate 3270 sessions, and is quite a bit easier to set up and use than s3270. 
pr3287 is the printer companion for the tools above, and allows printer output from a 3270 session to be directed to a Unix printer queue.

This feature is a compile-time option and requires the existence of the compface library routines, which are NOT supplied with the xmail sources.    X-Face headers are compressed bitmap images, typically of the face of the person owning such a header.  The compressed header contains only printable characters, which allows it to be included in a mail message.  The USENIX FaceSaver project is typically the source for these bitmaps, which are compressed into X-Face header format using the compface software tools written and distributed by James Ashton <jaa@cs.su.oz.au>.  The compface library is also provided with the distribution of the faces software, written by Rich Burridge, and is available by email from his archive server <rb-archive-server@Aus.Sun.COM>.

More precisely, grok is a program for displaying and editing strings arranged in a grid of rows and columns. Each row is presented as a "card" consisting of multiple columns, or "fields", that allow data entry. The presentation of the data is programmable. A user interface builder that allows the user to arrange fields on a card graphically is part of grok. Grok also supports a simple language that allows sophisticated queries and data retrieval. Grok comes with the above examples and a few others as prebuilt applications.

XTalk is a talk client which was written for use under the graphical user interface X11. It is full useable with mouse or the keyboard via shortcuts. The important functions are also accessible over the buttonstrip with easy understand symbols. 
The functionality compared with the "normal" talk was considerably expanded. It is possible to save the written and received text to any file. Moreover, you can scroll through the text. No information is lost. The telephone book function is very useful for frequently used talk partners. The connection parameter will show permanently in the status line under the buttonstrip. Open a second or third connection without great difficulty by choosing "File->New XTalk" from the menu. 
Very useful is the built-in file transfer function. It is based on an internal protocol and therefore only enabled if the partner also runs an XTalk client. While establishing the connection, XTalk checks whether there is an XTalk client running on the other end. If this is the case, the transfer menu is automatically enabled.

Z88X outputs the processed structure data and restrictions, calculates the stiffness matrices of the elements, compiles the stiffness matrix of the entire system, scales the equation system, solves the system with an in situ Cholesky method, and displays the displacements in ASCII format. 
This is why there are modules for calculating the stress for the node strength and a net generator.

Description:
MuPad is a program system for doing computer algebra. It is being developed at the University of Paderborn, Germany. 
Computer algebra systems provide symbolic handling of mathematical formulae and, supplied with expert knowledge, make it easier to handle. They allow interactive manipulation of mathematical objects, effortless functional programming of particular mathematical problems. Their immense effect on mathematical lessons at universities and high schools has already been noted. Even schools are starting to use it as part of their lessons. 
MuPAD is one of the first universal computer algebra systems. It is already well known for its object oriented language as well as for its steady growing implementations of mathematical algorithms. An extraordinary comfortable GUI, an interactive on-line help system, the included debugger and a powerful graphics tool are the main advantages of MuPAD. 
In 1993 MuPAD has been awarded with the "German-Austrian software price" followed by the First European Software Award in 1994.

For KDE, mwm, ctwm, and icewm, there is only support for keeping the menus up to date since these are very different from the other window managers, like fvwm. 

The icons used in the fvwm2 / fvwm95 menus are taken from the package 3dpixms which themselves are generated from the 3dpixm package.

Description:
From the Scwm home page (/usr/share/doc/packages/scwm/scwmrc/): 

Scwm is the Scheme-Configurable Window Manager. It is a window manager with a powerful configuration language based on Guile Scheme. Scwm has a number of advanced features, many implemented in the configuration language itself. It is in very active development currently, and continues to improve. 

Scwm was originally based on fvwm2 code. It is rapidly evolving in the internals, but we are striving to maintain compatibility on various levels. It now has a strict superset of fvwm2 features. Even fvwm2 modules may be executed through an adapter written in the configuration language. 

Features 
======== 

Scwm has a number of useful features, some of which are rarely seen in a window manager. Here are some highlights: 
- Full programmability using Guile Scheme. 
- Support for GUI scripting using guile-gtk (experimental quality). 
- Optional constraint-based window-layout system (new in v0.9). See README-constraints for information on getting started. 
- Fully documented the C-level primitives. 
- Much-improved documentation browsing capabilities from Emacs. 
- Multiple decoration styles, including mwm, fvwm and win95 so far. 
- Everything that can be configured can be changed on the fly at runtime. 
- A powerful external control protocol. The scwmexec program can be used to execute any window manager. 
- command at any time; scwmrepl gives you an interactive session with the window manager. 
- An emacs interaction mode: edit your .scwmrc in emacs, and evaluate the results immediately, without restarting. 
- Support for fvwm2 modules. 
- Multiple disjoint virtual desktops. 
- Animated move and windowshade operations. 
- Synthetic events (allowing you to bind keystrokes or mouse operations to sequences of clicks and keyboard commands). 
- Ability to load nearly any image type. 
- Timer hooks, input hooks, new window hooks. 
- Direct support for /etc/X11/wmconfig/ under RedHat GNU/Linux 5.x. 
- XLock menu that queries xlock for the available modes automatically. 

The code is fairly portable. It is known to work at least on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and Irix. 

Scwm comes with a number of example scwmrc files in the sample.scwmrc directory (/usr/share/doc/packages/scwm/scwmrc/) which demonstrate many of the useful features.

IMP does not require an IMAP server to be running on the machine you install it on unless you are intending to have it use the current machine for it's IMAP connections. (If you are connecting to a local server for your mail than you don't need IMAP) . IMP requires a database to be running if you want to use the extended features such as the addressbook, and prefs.  It currently supports PostgreSQL, MySql, Oracle, Informix, and Sybase.

Yfiton:

Description:
FreeS/WAN is an IPsec implementation which allows building Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). A typical VPN setup consists of two trusted networks, connected over an insecure network, typically the Internet. FreeS/WAN allows you to create an encrypted tunnel through the insecure area. Unlike CIPE, it is interoperable with other operating systems or even routers IPsec implementations. 
There is no longer support for the insecure DES algorithm. For interoperability your partner also needs to understand 3DES encryption. 
SuSE has added the X.509 support (http://www.strongsec.com/km_freeswan/) for you. 
It contains strong cryptographic routines. The US government does not allow to (re)export this software out of the US, regardless of where it has been written. Nowadays, you may register with the US authorities and may get granted a license to export it though. Some other countries (Russia, France, ...) may also have regulations preventing the import, export or usage of this piece of software.

This capability allows developers to find application bugs that are difficult to locate and provides developers information that can be used to tune the performance of their system or application.  It can be used to solve network, database or embedded system problems.  A major differentiator of SpyKer is that it does not require a pre-instrumented kernel.  The SpyKer trace driver dynamically inserts trace points at run-time and saves trace data to memory or files.  A capture screen allows users to configure buffer size and location with start and stop point selection.  SpyKer uses a Java(tm) based GUI to display trace data in different colors to highlight events.  Info, zoom, search, measure tools are provided to analyze captured data. Contact Lynuxworks at http://www.lynuxworks.com/suse_spyker_eval to receive a demo license key or purchase this innovative trace tool.

## -----> SuSEfirewall <-----
##
Filename:      SuSEfirewall.spm
Label:         The SuSE version of the packet filter ("firewall") setup
Description:
The SuSEfirewall can be used to make a host or a network more secure. You can control, which services should be reachable to the outside  world and thus reduce the exposure to be compromised by design flaws or vulnerabilities in the daemons that provide those services. 
For all experts out there: this is NOT a complete firewall setup but  a simple (no, not simple, it tries actually to be clever) packet filter. But people look for such functionality under the keyword firewall,  that's why this package is named like this. 
Note that there is a package personal-firewall which is meant to just block all incoming connections, which is normally what you want if you don't offer any services, e.g. because you use a dial-in internet connection. Use personal-firewall for such occasions. 
Also note that there is the new SuSEfirewall2 which uses the iptables functionality of the 2.4 kernels. (Note that you can use the old SuSE- firewall on 2.4 kernels as well.) It's not as well tested as the old ipchains based SuSEfirewall, of course, but offers some new possibilities due to the stateful design of the new iptables filtering mechanism.

## -----> SuSEfirewall2 <-----

Filename:      SuSEfirewall2.spm
Label:         Packetfilter using 2.4 kernel's iptables/netfilter
Description:
This package is the successor of the SuSEfirewall (firewals) package. Like SuSEfirewall, SuSEfirewall2 implements a packetfilter to allow system administrators to protect their computer and network by restricting the possibilities of other hosts to connect to them. This potentially saves you from suffering under the design flaws and vulnerabilties that are found from time to time in various daemons. 
Unlike the old ipchains based SuSEfirewall, this version uses the new iptables/netfilter packet filtering infrastructure that comes with 2.4 kernels. It allows even more flexible rule setup and, specifically, the creation of a stateful firewall, as it keeps track of connections and  has the notion of related connections. 
Note that for simply protecting a single host from attacks, you're probably best of using the personal-firewall that comes with SuSE Linux. 
Note that the old SuSEfirewall can also be run on 2.4 kernels, as there is support for the old ipchains based rules in 2.4. SuSEfirewall2 can coexist with SuSEfirewall. This may be useful for configurations, where you sometimes boot 2.2 and sometimes 2.4 kernels. The SuSEfirewall scripts will detect if SuSEfirewall2 is installed and enabled and if a 2.4 kernel is running and in such a case will just not start SuSEfirewall, resulting in SuSEfirewall2 to be active.

The node best suited (at the time of execution) for the job given, will be chosen to execute the job. This is an approach different from that of traditional Queue systems. A job is not queued, it is executed immediately if any suitable host (for the given job type) can be found. This makes the system suitable for execution of a large number of small jobs, such as compilers. A traditional queue system will often take up too much time managing it's queues, to allow tasks such as large-scale compilations to gain much speedup using it.

AOLserver is a World Wide Web server that provides access control and database connections and runs on multiple UNIX platforms. AOLserver can access SQL databases including Sybase, SOLID, Postgres, and some third-party database drivers. AOLserver is extendable with both C and Tcl APIs that expose core functions and provide primitives for accessing the database. AOLserver also provides optional CGI support, although the C and Tcl APIs are more powerful, offer superior performance, and are easier to use. You can configure multiple servers within one AOLserver configuration file, and then specify which server to run when you run AOLserver. AOLserver also uses a multi-threaded design on all supported platforms. You can configure the number of threads each server can use. AOLserver offers direct connections to SQL databases such as SOLID and Postgres, plus an external database connection to Sybase. Third-party database drivers are provided for Oracle, Informix, and Interbase. You can even configure AOLserver to have connections to multiple databases and specify which databases are available to each server. AOLserver also includes server administration capabilities. An access control system allows you to specify separate permissions for each combination of URL and HTTP method (GET, PUT, or POST). You can also specify users and groups who are allowed access to AOLserver.

Filename:      apache.spm
Label:         The Apache Web server
Description:
The Apache HTTP server. Very few programs have spread so quickly and attracted such a large following in such a short time as this HTTP server.  According to Netcraft, Apache runs on about 49.05%% of all servers attached to the Internet. That represents about 1,182,142 systems. It has replaced within only a few months the NCSA server which, until then was the unchallenged favorite.  This is undoubtedly because Apache was derived from the NCSA server sources and that its configuration is compatible to that of NCSA/1.3. 

The Apache project was established to provide a forum for the development of a freely available HTTP server. The goal is to develop a secure, efficient, and easily extendable server, which also closely parallels the development of the HTTP protocol. Thus Apache became a replacement to NCSA/1.3. 

Besides better performance, the removal of known errors, and better conformance to HTTP standards (HTTP/1.1), Apache offers the following useful features, which are often missing in other servers: 

* password files, used to protect documents from unauthorized access, can be indexed in various ways. The search for an entry is as a result more efficient than in ordinary text files. 

* client-request errors can be responded to in a flexible manner. CGI scripts can be used to analyze the error and generate more informative replies to both the client and the administrator than the HTTP status codes offer. 

* there is no restriction on aliasing and redirection. The Alias and Redirect directives can be used in arbitrary number and depth. 

* Apache can choose the best representation of a resource based on the browser-supplied preferences for media type, languages, character set and encoding ("Content Negotiation"). 

* with Apache you can implement several virtual servers. Thus requests to different IP addresses (referring to the same computer) can be distinguished and, depending on the IP address, appropriately handled. 

Further advantages are the module concept and the well-documented API (Application Programmers Interface). Extensions are easily developed and new features are easily integrated into the server. For example, an implementation of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) from Netscape exists for Apache. This permits secure communication between server and client. 
Apache is installed in the following directories: 
/etc/httpd                      -> configuration files 
/usr/sbin/httpd                 -> server binary 
/var/log/httpd/                 -> protocol files 
/var/run/httpd.pid              -> server PID 
/usr/local/httpd                -> server root 
/etc/init.d/apache              -> Start/Stop script

Description:
What is mod_backhand? 

mod_backhand is project that allows seamless redirection of HTTP requests from one web server to another. This redirection can be used to target machines with under-utilized resources, thus providing fine-grained, per-request load balancing of web requests. 

Backhand is a project that was initiated in class at The Johns Hopkins University in The Department of Computer Science. After a simple proof of concept, written in C++, the project was pursued as a graduate qualifier project. 

A proof of concept was realized, but a deployable product was needed. In order for public use, testing and, ultimately, acceptance, we wished to provide drop-in functionality in the most popular web server on the net. 

mod_backhand was born. This drop-in module for the Apache Web Server provides a turnkey solution for intra-cluster redirection of HTTP on a per-request basis. The redirection is based on various system resources available within the cluster. This service is provided seamlessly, preserving remote host information for access/authentication purposes. As with the methodology of Apache, the redirection mechanism can be enabled or disable for individual directories. 

System resources are announced by the module to the cluster via ethernet broadcasts and/or IP multicasts. These resources are made available to the decision making algorithms that drive mod_backhand.

bc is an interpreter that supports numbers of arbitrary precision and the interactive execution of statements. There are some similarities in the syntax to the C programming language. A standard math library is available through command line options. When used, the math library is read in before any other input files. bc then reads in all other files from the command line, evaluating their contents. Then, bc reads from standard input (usually the keyboard). 
The dc program is also included. Dc is a calculator which supports reverse-polish notation and allows unlimited precision arithmetic. Macros can also be defined. Normally, dc reads from standard in but can also read in files specified on the command line. A calculator with reverse-polish notation saves numbers to a stack. Arguments to mathematical operations (operands) are "pushed" onto the stack until the next operator is read in which "pops" its arguments off the stack and "pushes" its results back onto the stack.

This allows stub resolvers that support AAAA records  but not A6 record chains or binary labels to perform lookups in domains  that make use of these IPv6 DNS features. - Performance has been improved. - The named.conf parser has been completely rewritten. It now supports "include" directives in more places such as inside "view" statements, and it no longer has any reserved words. - The "rndc status" command is now implemented. rndc can now be configured automatically. - A BIND 8 compatible stub resolver library is now included in lib/bind. - OpenSSL has been removed from the distribution. This means that to use DNSSEC, OpenSSL must be installed and the --with-openssl option must be supplied to configure. This does not apply to the use of TSIG, which does not require OpenSSL.

Bootparamd looks first in /etc/bootparams for an entry for that particular client; if a local bootparams file doesn't exist, it looks at the appropriate Network Information Service (NIS) map.  Some network boot loaders (notably Sun's) rely on special boot server code on the server, in addition to the RARP and TFTP servers. This bootparamd server process is compatible with SunOS bootparam clients and servers which need that boot server code.

## -----> bulk_mailer <-----
##
Filename:      bulk_mailer.spm
Label:         Bulk_mailer
Description:
This is a C program to do "bulk" mailing.  For input, it takes a file of recipient addresses (one address per line) and a message (with headers already attached) to be sent to the recipients.  It sorts the recipient list by reversed domain (so similar ones sort together), splits up the recipients into several groups containing no more than N domains each, creates an SMTP envelope for each group of recipients, and feeds that envelope to "/usr/lib/sendmail -bs". 

Splitting the envelopes up allows sendmail to perform delivery in parallel, so instead of having one large queue entry (for which sendmail might take awhile to get around to attempting delivery for some recipients), it has several smaller queue entries.  Depending on your point-of-view, this can still be considered "cluttering up your mail queue", but it does seem to deliver messages more quickly to most recipients. 

The core of this program was extracted from a somewhat strange mailing list manager called na-net; it was designed to efficiently send out mail to 5000 people at a time.  I have used this program to attempt delivery of a message to over 12000 recipients around the world, within a few hours.  I'm currently using bulk_mailer as a back-end for several mailing lists of modest size. 

However, the program is not extensively tested, and may not work well in all environments.  (In particular, if your system has per-user process quotas, or a small number of process table entries, you will want to modify this program to recover gracefully.) 

There's no warranty on this, but you're welcome to use it if you want.

Cocoon is a 100% pure Java publishing framework that relies on new W3C technologies (such as DOM, XML, and XSL) to provide web content. 
The Cocoon project aims to change the way web information is created, rendered and served. The new Cocoon paradigm is based on the fact that document content, style and logic are often created by different individuals or working groups. Cocoon aims for a complete separation of the three layers, allowing the three layers to be independently designed, created and managed, reducing management overhead, increasing work reuse and reducing time to market.

The archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe. 
This package normally also includes the program "rmt", which provides remote tape drive control. Since there is a compatible 'rmt' in the 'dump' package we didn't put 'rmt' into this package.

Filename:      cryptlib.spm
Label:         cryptlib
Description:
cryptlib is a powerful security toolkit which allows even inexperienced crypto programmers to easily add encryption and authentication services to their software. The high-level interface provides anyone with the ability to add strong security capabilities to an application in as little as half an hour, without needing to know any of the low-level details which make the encryption or authentication work. Because of this, cryptlib dramatically reduces the cost involved in adding security to new or existing applications. 
cryptlib provides a transparent and consistent interface to a number of widely-used security services and algorithms which are accessed through a straightforward, standardised interface with parameters such as the algorithm and key size being selectable by the user. Included as core components are implementations of the most popular encryption and authentication algorithms, Blowfish, CAST, DES, triple DES, IDEA, RC2, RC4, RC5, Safer, Safer-SK, and Skipjack conventional encryption, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-160 and SHA hash algorithms, HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA, HMAC-RIPEMD-160, and MDC-2 MAC algorithms, and Diffie-Hellman, DSA, Elgamal, and RSA public-key encryption. (IDEA and RC5 are not compiled for SuSE Linux!) 
On top of the basic encryption services, cryptlib provides an extensive range of high-level capabilities including full X.509 certificate handling with support for all X.509v3 and IETF PKIX certificate features as well as support for SET, Microsoft AuthentiCode, S/MIME, and SSL client and server certificates, handling of certification requests and CRL's including automated checking of certificates against CRL's, creation and processing of PKCS #7 certificate chains, and a full range of certification authority (CA) functions. Alongside the certificate handling, cryptlib provides a sophisticated key database interface which allows the use of a wide range of key database types ranging from PKCS #15 key files and PGP keyrings through to commercial-grade RDBMS's and LDAP directories with optional SSL protection. To complement its key management capabilities, cryptlib provides a complete S/MIME implementation with full-strength encryption, allowing email, files, and EDI transactions to be authenticated with digital signatures and encrypted in an industry-standard format. 
In addition to its built-in capabilities, cryptlib can make use of the crypto capabilities of a variety of external crypto devices such as hardware crypto accelerators, Fortezza cards, PKCS #11 devices, and crypto smart cards. The crypto device interface also provides a convenient general-purpose plug-in capability for adding new functionality which will be automatically used by cryptlib.

Filename:      dosemu.spm
Label:         The DOS emulator
Description:
This package allows MS-DOS programs to be started in Linux. A virtual machine (the DOS box) provides the necessary BIOS functions and emulates most of the chip devices (e.g. timer, interrupt- and keyboard controler). 
Documentation can be found in '/usr/share/doc/packages/dosemu' and in the man page, as well as in the sources. 
Starting with version 1.0.2 DOSEMU configuration files are no longer below /etc but in the user's HOME directory below ~/dosemu. DOSEMU does no longer have the SUID bit set, so if you need access to hardware that requires root privileges, you must run DOSEMU as 'root'. 
If you rely on the old configuration scheme, you can get it back by using 'dosemu.bin' instead of 'dosemu' ('dos' and 'xdos' have been renamed to 'dosemu' resp. 'xdosemu'). 
The parameter $_hogthreshold in '~/dosemu/conf/dosemu.conf' defines how often an 'idling' DOSEMU should return the CPU to Linux and its default value '(1)' means 'all power to Linux'. The higher this value is, the more more CPU power is dedicated to DOSEMU. The value '(0)' disables this feature completely, hence: 'all power to DOSEMU'. If that isn't fast enough, you (running UID root) can get maximum performance with 
nice -19 dos -D-a 2>/dev/null 
Don't be surprised though if the other Linux processes then run very sluggishly. 
On sensitive systems you _never_ should offer a suid-root DOSEMU world readable, because even if the '$_secure' option in dosemu.conf is set, its not avoidable that some DPMI-clients (most likely Dos4gw based ones) may succeed in accessing the whole user space (including DOSEMU code) and thus gain root access. A comfortable solution is to have two copies of the DOSEMU binary, a non-suid-root one for world access and a suid-root one (protected by file permissions) only available to trusted users.

This project has been under way since early 1991, beginning with the small original file included with the MOKE (Mark's Own Kanji Editor) Japanese word-processing package. It reached a size of nearly 103,000 entries when it was split into two files: EDICT containing the "normal" dictionary entries, and ENAMDICT containing names. Both files are used by a number of software packages and thousands of users world-wide. The EDICT file is now over 60,000 entries and the ENAMDICT file over 160,000.

o Maintaining software for a cluster of equally configured workstations centrally. o A low-cost X-terminal. o A low cost user platform where remote partitions are mounted by NFS and you are willing to accept the slowness of data transfers that results from NFS, compared to a local disk. o Various kinds of remote servers, e.g. a tape drive server that can be accessed with the RMT protocol. o Routers. o Machines doing tasks in environments unfriendly to disks.

The current production version of expat can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip. The directory xmltok contains a low-level library for tokenizing XML. The interface is documented in xmltok/xmltok.h. The directory xmlparse contains an XML parser library which is built on top of the xmltok library. The interface is documented in xmlparse/xmlparse.h. The directory sample contains a simple example program using this interface; sample/build.bat is a batch file to build the example using Visual C++. The directory xmlwf contains the xmlwf application, which uses the xmlparse library. The arguments to xmlwf are one or more files which are each to be checked for well-formedness. An option -d dir can be specified; for each well-formed input file the corresponding canonical XML will be written to dir/f, where f is the filename (without any path) of the input file. A -x option will cause references to external general entities to be processed. A -s option will make documents that are not standalone cause an error (a document is considered standalone if either it is intrinsically standalone because it has no external subset and no references to parameter entities in the internal subset or it is declared as standalone in the XML declaration).

Filename:      fping.spm
Label:         Ping to multiple hosts
Description:
fping is a ping-like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is responding. fping differs from ping in a way that you can specify any number of targets on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping. Instead of sending pings to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion. 
In the default mode, if a target replies, it is noted and removed from the list of targets to check; if a target does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry limit it is designated as unreachable. fping also supports sending a specified number of pings to a target, or looping indefinitely (as in ping ). 
Unlike ping, fping is meant to be used in scripts, so its output is designed to be easy to parse.

Unlike CIPE, it is interoperable with other operating systems or even routers IPsec implementations. 
There is no longer support for the insecure DES algorithm. For interoperability your partner also needs to understand 3DES encryption. 
SuSE has added the X.509 support (http://www.strongsec.com/freeswan/) for you. 
It contains strong cryptographic routines. The US government does not allow to (re)export this software out of the US, regardless of where it has been written. Nowadays, you may register with the US authorities and may get granted a license to export it though. Some other countries (Russia, France, ...) may also have regulations preventing the import, export or usage of this piece of software.

FreeWnn is a Kana-Kanji translation system, originally developed by a joint project formed by Kyoto University, OMRON Corporation [formerly known as Tateishi Electronics Co.], and ASTEC Inc. Further developement and maintenance is now done by the "FreeWnn Project" (http://www.freewnn.org). 

The name "Wnn", is an acronym for the Japanese sentence "Watashino Namaeha Nakanodesu" (literally, it means "my name is Nakano."), is derived from a goal of the project: to develop a system powerful enough to translate a whole sentence like that at once.  The source code has been written in C, and was distributed freely. Consequently, Wnn spread widely among workstation platforms, and became a de-facto standard as a Kana-Kanji translation system for UNIX operation systems. 

Wnn works in client-server manner. The server portion of Wnn, or jserver, is used as a Kana-Kanji translation engine for clients like "xwnmo" and "kinput2" (input systems for the X Window System), or for clients like "Egg", which is part of Mule (=Multi lingual Emacs) and XEmacs.

Label:         The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
Description:
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising compiler for Haskell 98, GHC compiles Haskell to either native code or C.  It implements numerous experimental language extensions to Haskell 98; for example: concurrency, a foreign language interface, multi-parameter type classes, scoped type variables, existential and universal quantification, unboxed types, exceptions, weak pointers, and so on.  GHC comes with a generational garbage collector, and a space and time profiler. 

GHC is directed at two main groups of users: 

Application writers. We think that Haskell is a great language to write applications in, and are dead keen for GHC to be used for this purpose. To this end we have worked hard on GHC's external interfaces: particularly the ability to call and exchange data with foreign languages and components (see HaskellDirect).  (If you are interested, here's a list of some real-world applications of functional languages.) 

Implementors. GHC is specifically designed to act as a "motherboard" into which others can "plug in" their own strictness analyser, profiler, front end, back end, or other special pass. Learning enough about GHC to do this is a fairly substantial exercise, but it's a lot quicker than writing the whole system yourself. Even more important, it means that there's enough scaffolding to really stress your gizmo against real programs (the NoFib suite provides some...), rather than toy ones. 

This release contains Manuel M. T. Chakravarty's <chak@is.tsukuba.ac.jp> 62-tuple patch.

· organizing problem reports into a database and notifying responsible parties of suspected bugs; 
· allowing support personnel and their managers to edit, query and report on accumulated bugs; and 
· providing a reliable archive of problems with a given program and a history of the life of the program by preserving its reported problems and their subsequent solutions. 
GNATS offers many of the same features offered by more generic databases.  You can query and edit existing problem reports (PRs) as well as obtain reports on groups of PRs.  The database itself is simply an ordered repository for problem reports; each PR receives a unique, incremental PRnumber, which identifies it throughout its lifetime.

From the README: 
---------------- 

gnotepad++ is an easy-to-use, yet fairly feature-rich, simple text editor for Unix based systems running X11 and using GTK (the Gimp ToolKit) or GNOME.  gnotepad++ was designed to have as little bloat as possible, while still providing many of the common features found in a modern GUI-based text editor.  It is still fairly light-weight, especially for the features it offers, and aims to remain that way. 

The "+" in gnotepad++ is there to differentiate it from other GTK-based text editors which may call themselves "gnotepad+".  Additionally, gnotepad++ is not intended to be fancy, so it leverages its text editing capabilities on the GTK Text Widget.  Hence, if you are looking for a programmers's editor, look for another text editor or help improve the GTK Text Widget. 

Features 
-------- 

- Multiple windows, multiple documents 
- Complete preferences system (no need to edit any config files) 
- Recent document menu 
- Popup Document list 
- Popup Window list 
- Popup Messages box 
- Menu accelerators that work

From the README file: 
Gnumeric is still a young program and it is advancing steadily. 

This is a partial list of Features implemented in Gnumeric, we need documentation for these: 

- Autofill Number autofill (computes delta, autofills from that) String autofill (daynames, months are built in). String+Number combo integer autofill Formula autofill. 

- Drag and drop selection. Select an area and use the border to drag the contents (shift/control/alt are modifiers to copy or move) 

- Selection - Multiple selection is supported, hold down control key to augment the existing selection (it might be discotinuous). 
- Walking selection Use return/tab and shift-return/shift-tab to capture information in a selection. 
- Fill quickly a region with the same text: just enter the text in a selection and press control-enter. 

- Number formatting - The formatting of numbers is very powerful, we do emulate the Excel number formatting specification. 
- Format rules: you can use rules to specify which format to use 
- Format colors: you can specify a color to format with in the format. 

- Column/Row resizing - Drag the column/row division to adjust the column and row dimenssions. 
- To make changes to various columns/rows simultaneously, select the columns and then change the dimension of one of them. 

- To edit the contents of a cell that already has a value, press F2 key. 

- When typing a formula, you can use the cursor keys to select a cell or a cell range in the expression.  This will only work if a cell name is valid at the cursor point. 
To specify a cell range, just move to the start of the cell range and then hold down the shift key while making the size of the selection cursor bigger. 

- An expression is evaluated constantly on top of the current selection.  There is a number of pre-defined auto-compute expressions, you can change this by right clicking on this expression (it is on the bottom right corner) 

- If you drag a selection with button 3 instead of button one there is no default action, rather, a menu pops up with a list of possible actions to perform. 

- Gnumeric distinguishes regular text from formulas by preceding formulas with an equal sign.  So to enter an expression you have to enter for example: =1+2. 

- Control-Space selects a column 
- Control-A selects all 
- SHift-Space selects the row. 
- Selection-keys + control extend the selection to boundary of worksheet. 
- SHift-Backspace:  Collapses selection to active cell. 
- Home: move to the beginning of the row. 
- Control-Home: move to the cell A1

With these tools, an already running Emacs can be accessed "externally," for example, in order to edit a file or run a code in Emacs Lisp. This way, there is no need to start a new Emacs each time another application loads an editor.

Description:
Modules for GnuPG with licensing or security issues. Useful for interaction with PGP2, see end of file. Contains the gpg-2compat wrapper script from Gero Treuner, which allows the mixed use of RSA and DSA keys with GnuPG. Please read the following notes carefully! 
IDEA: Patented by Ascom Systec Ltd. of CH-5506 Maegenwil. Only freely usable for certain non-profit purpose: This software product contains the IDEA algorithm as described and claimed in US patent 5,214,703, EPO patent 0482154 (covering Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK), and Japanese patent application 508119/1991, "Device for the conversion of a digital block and use of same" (hereinafter referred to as "the algorithm").  Any use of the algorithm for commercial purposes is thus subject to a license from Ascom Systec Ltd. of CH-5506 Maegenwil (Switzerland), being the patentee and sole owner of all rights, including the trademark IDEA. 
RIJNDAEL: The winner of the NIST competition to find a new standard crypto algorithm (so, it's ths successor of DES). It's now included into GnuPG 1.0.4, so it's not included in here any more. 
RSA: This code should not have been exported _to_ the United States without a license agreement with PKP prior to Sept. 20, 2000, as it was encumbered by U.S. patent #4,405,829. The RSA support now went into GnuPG-1.0.3 and is therefore not in this package any more. 
RSAREF: This module is Copyright (c) 1999 Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@non-us.debian.org> and is placed into the public domain, do with it what you will. It comes with no warrenty express or implied. RSAREF is limited in key size and in the coding of the encrypted data. This module isn't terribly great as RSAREF has no concept of secure memory so the secret key and the symmetric cipher are written to insecure memory in several places in this code and within the RSAREF lib. NOT CURRENTLY BUILT. 
SKIPJACK: GPL -- but not recommended for use. 
3DES: An alternative 3DES implementation Requires Eric Young's SSLeay or the OpenSSL library. NOT CURRENTLY BUILT.

Description:
GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG easier for applications. It provides a high-level Crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification, and key management. Currently it uses GnuPG as its back-end, but the API isn't restricted to this engine. It is planned to add other back-ends to it. 
Who Should use GPGME? 
Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a complicated programming task, it is suggested that all software should try to use GPGME instead. This way bug fixes or improvements can be done at a central place and every applications benefits from this. Especially authors of MUAs should consider to use GPGME. It is even planned to created a set of standard widgets for common key selection tasks.

Hotplugging is a new feature of Linux, with the goal of letting you plug in new devices and use them immediately. That means that users won't need to learn as much system administration. Systems will at least partially be autoconfiguring themselves. Initially, it includes support for USB and PCI (Cardbus) devices, and can automatically configure network interfaces. 
Now that basic USB and Cardbus hotplugging seems to behave properly, upcoming work will likely involve integration with other Linux subsystems such as input, pcmcia_cs, 1394, disk/storage (starting with SCSI), networking, printing, power management such as APM and ACPI, and more. Kernel 2.5 work will improve autoconfiguration support for Linux, likely including more unified support for stable device names and user mode device management tools.

In addition, it comes packaged with the libraries defined in the most recent version of the Haskell Library Report and with extension libraries which are compatible with GHC 3.0 and later. 
Hugs is best used as a Haskell program development system: it boasts extremely fast compilation, supports incremental compilation, and has the convenience of an interactive interpreter (within which one can move from module to module to test different portions of a program). However, being an interpreter, it does not nearly match the run-time performance of, for example, GHC or HBC.

This package contains all necessary scripts and programs to setup and use the infrared port for printing or communicating. The start/stop scripts are prepared to access the UART emulation (so called `SIR' mode) with 115 kbit/s data transfer rate. This is supported by the most notebooks with infrared interface. 
After starting the infrared protocol manager `irmanger' with the command `rcirda start' you can send data to your printer by using the device file /dev/irlpt0. If you like to talk to other computers with infrared interface or to a mobile phone you can use the serial emulation provided by the device file /dev/ircomm0. 
Please take a look at the README file located in /usr/share/doc/packages/irda/README and into the IRDA HOWTO which is located in /usr/share/doc/howto/en/IR-HOWTO.gz. If the infrared port on your notebook is located on a different IO or IRQ address then IO address 0x2f8 (/dev/ttyS1) or interrupt 3 you should use yast to change the variables IRDA_PORT and IRDA_IRQ in the configuration file /etc/rc.config.

Label:         Independent JPEG Group's JPEG Software
Description:
Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing "real-world" scenes (most of the time there are pictures that have been scanned-in with a scanner). Cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit. You should note that the output of JPEG is not necessarily the same as its input. If this is a factor for you, then don't use it. With typical real-world scenes, JPEG can achieve high compression rates, without noticeable differences. If you can accept pictures of lower quality, JPEG can achieve amazingly high compression rates. 
There are some library functions available for reading and writing JPEG files. The 'cjpeg' and 'djpeg' applications use the library to make conversions between JPEG and other popular graphics file formats possible. The library is meant to be used within other applications. 
Cjpeg compresses the input file, or standard input if no filename was given, and produces a JPEG/JFIF to standard output. Currently supported input file formats include: PPM (PBMPLUS color format), PGM (PBMPLUS Grayscale format), BMP, GIF, Targa and RLE (Utah Raster Toolkit Format). (RLE is only supported if the RLE library is available.) Djpeg decompresses a JPEG file in one of the above mentioned formats.

The most entries of the kakasi dictionary is derived form the SKK dictionaries.  If you have some interests in the naming of "KAKASI", please consult to Japanese-English dictionary. :-) 

(1) "Romaji" is alphabetical description of Japanese pronunciation.

Label:         Japanese handwriting recognition
Description:
KanjiPad is a very simple program for handwriting recognition - The user draws a character into the box, then requests translation. The best candidates are displayed along the right hand side of the window and can be selected for pasting into other programs. 
It is meant primarily for dictionary purposes for learners of Japanese - it does not support entering kana, so its usefulness as an input method is limited. Furthermore, if you already know the reading of a character, conventional pronunciation based methods of entering the character are probably faster. 
However, KanjiPad is sometimes useful for entering very unusual characters, even if the pronunciation is known, because pronunciation based input methods often fail for rarely used characters.

It means that libnids code watches all local network traffic, cooks received datagrams a bit, and provides convenient information on them to analyzing modules of NIDS. Libnids performs: 

a) assembly of TCP segments into TCP streams 
b) IP defragmentation 
c) TCP port scan detection 

More technical info can be found in MISC file.  So, if you intend to develop a custom NIDS, you don't have to build low-level network code. If you decide to use libnids, you have got E-component ready - you can focus on implementing other parts of NIDS.

libraw1394 is the only supported interface to the kernel side raw1394 of the Linux IEEE-1394 subsystem, which provides direct access to the connected 1394 buses to user space.  Through libraw1394/raw1394, applications can directly send to and receive from other nodes without requiring a kernel driver for the protocol in question. 
The reason for making a library the interface to the kernel is to avoid a program dependancy on the kernel version, which would hinder development and optimization of raw1394.  If development changed the protocol and made it incompatible with previous versions only the libraw1394 has to be upgraded to match the kernel version (instead of all applications).

Description:
The LPRng software is an enhanced, extended, and portable implementation of the Berkeley LPR print spooler functionality. While providing the same interface and meeting RFC1179 requirements, the implementation is completely new and provides support for the following features: lightweight (no databases needed) lpr, lpc, and lprm programs; dynamic redirection of print queues; automatic job holding; highly verbose diagnostics; multiple printers serving a single queue; and a greatly improved permission and authorization mechanism. 
LPRng provides emulation packages for the SVR4 lp and lpstat programs, eliminating the need for another print spooler package. These emulation packages can be modified according to local requirements, in order to support vintage printing systems. 
Attention: Interoperability with older LPD implementations requires privileged access to ports.  Therefore all affected client-programs ship with SUID root priviledges!

Description:
Similar to openssh, this is a free implementation of the secure shell protocol. The package consists of the lshd daemon accepting connections to port 22 (ssh), the lsh client and tools for key management. 
lsh is compiled without support for the IDEA algorithm required by ssh1 clients. The reason is that IDEA is encumbered by patents, and may only be used free of charge in certain non-commercial environments. 
lsh however can be installed along with (open)ssh and supports fallback to a opensshd resp. sshd1 daemon for such connections. 
Docu can be found in /usr/share/doc/packages/lsh/ The startup of lshd is controlled by START_LSHD in rc.config. 
Note: This package is still under development. If you want high security and stability, better use openssh for now! lsh also misses PAM support.

The LT XML tool-kit includes stand-alone tools for a wide range of processing of well-formed XML documents, including searching and extracting, down-translation (e.g. report generation, formatting), tokenising and sorting. 

For special purposes beyond what the pre-constructed tools can achieve, extending their functionality and/or creating new tools is easy using the LT XML API. Minimal applications require less than one-half page of C code to express. 

LT XML provides two views of an XML file; one as a flat stream of markup elements and text; a second as a sequence of tree-structured XML elements. The two views can be mixed, allowing great flexibility in the manipulation of XML documents. It also includes a powerful, yet simple, querying language, which allows the user to quickly and easily select those parts of an XML document which are of interest.

Label:         Cool Web interface to Majordomo v1.9x
Description:
MajorCool is a CGI script written in Perl that provides a Web interface to Majordomo v1.9x*. It is intended to run co-located with the Majordomo program (ie, both list-server and Web on the same host). Employing a variety of Web/GUI techniques such as Balloon Help, Per-User Preferences, and MouseOver cues, MajorCool puts a friendly face on top of the Majordomo list management processes. 
"If you run a Majordomo service, go get MajorCool!" -- Mark Rauterkus, E-Marketing Digest 
MajorCool was originally designed as an administrative front-end to the popular mailing list manager, allowing novice list-owners to manage their list configuration and subscriber base. With the easy-to-use password protected screens, list managers can: 
-    Edit the list config file. Presentation of the complex list configuration file is simplified through the intuitive use of HTML radio buttons and text fields. 
-    Update the subscriber file via an easy-to-use text window. Changes to the list are converted to the appropriate individual approved subscribe and unsubscribe commands. 
-    Manage the moderator's Approval Queue, deleting, rejecting, or approving BOUNCE messages that require review. No more messing with mail headers! 
-    Edit files in the Approval Queue prior to action. Limited only by browser memory constraints. 
-    Create or edit the list's info and intro files. 
-    Download the list configuration file via e-mail. 
In addition to its list administration functions, MajorCool also provides a site-oriented view of the list-server's lists. MajorCool extends the address matching capabilities of Majordomo through the use of configurable siteaddr modules, permitting external directory sources such as X.500 to supply name-to-address conversions and provide pattern-matching address comparisons. These features enable MajorCool to identify list subscribers by multiple valid addresses, allowing end-users to interactively: 
-    View lists available on the server: All lists on the system. Unsubscribed lists. Subscribed lists (regardless of the address used for subscription). Lists with names or descriptions that match a certain pattern. 
-    Subscribe or unsubscribe to any list. 
-    View the list's info or intro files. 
-    View members of a list. 
Lastly, MajorCool provides a mailing list request mechanism, allowing end-users to ask that a list be created, renamed, or deleted. This request can be mailed to the Majordomo owner, or passed to an external program to perform whatever actions are desired. (Sample applications are provided to implement list creation, renaming, and/or deletion on-the-fly.) 
-- 
To configure MajorCool change to /usr/lib/majorcool and run "sh ./Configure". This script will prompt for some installation values and save the output to a default.sh file. This file can be edited at any time. 
For more details see "/usr/lib/majorcool/Docs/install.htm".

## -----> mod_python <-----

Filename:      mod_python.spm
Label:         Python module for the Apache web server
Description:
Mod_python allows embedding Python within the Apache http server for a considerable boost in performance and added flexibility in designing web based applications. 

Apache processes requests in stages (e.g. read the request, parse headers, check access, etc.). These stages can be implemented by functions called handlers. Traditionally, handlers are written in C and compiled into Apache modules. Mod_python provides a way to extend Apache functionality by writing Apache handlers in Python. For a detailed description of the Apache request processing process, see the Apache API Notes. 

For most programmers, the request and the authentication handlers provide everything required. To ease migration from CGI and Httpdapy, two handlers are provided that simulate these environments allowing a user to run his scripts under mod_python with (for the most part) no changes to the code. 

Mod_python originates from a project called Httpdapy. For a long time Httpdapy was not called mod_python because Httpdapy was not meant to be Apache-specific. Httpdapy was designed to be cross-platform and in fact was initially written for the Netscape server.

SQL is the most popular database language in the world. MySQL is a client/server implementation that consists of a server daemon mysqld and many different client programs and libraries. 
The main goals of MySQL are speed, robustness and ease of use. MySQL was originally developed because the developers at TcX needed a SQL server that could handle very large databases an order of magnitude faster than what any database vendor could offer to them. They have now been using MySQL since 1996 in an environment with more than 40 databases containing 10,000 tables, of which more than 500 have more than 7 million rows. This is about 100 gigabytes of mission-critical data. 
The base upon which MySQL is built is a set of routines that have been used in a highly demanding production environment for many years. While MySQL is still in development, it already offers a rich and highly useful function set. 
The official way to pronounce MySQL is "My Ess Que Ell" (Not MY-SEQUEL).

- Booting a diskless client either from an EPROM 
or from a floppy without additional utility tools 
- The Bootrom code can use many standard DOS packet 
drivers and therefore supports almost any PC 
network card. 
- Easy configuration of the bootrom under UNIX 
- The bootrom can load a BOOTP vendor extension 
file in order to support more space for tags 
according to RFC 1533 
- Using the bootrom menu support it's possible to 
optionally boot different operating systems. 
- Even if there is a hard disk installed in the 
client computer, he bootrom can be used as a 
boot manager, since it also allows booting from 
any partition. 
- Cross-gateway booting 
- Bootrom runs on any 80x86 processor but is 
optimized for the 386+. 
- Able to boot different operating systems. Linux 
and MS-DOS (and clones) are currently supported.

Description:
NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that encapsulates the best of ttcp and netperf and visually represents the network performance under a variety of conditions. By taking the end-to-end application view of a network, NetPIPE clearly shows the overhead associated with different protocol layers. Netpipe answers such questions as: how soon will a given data block of size k arrive at its destination? Which network and protocol will transmit size k blocks the fastest? What is a given network's effective maximum throughput and saturation level?  Does there exist a block size k for which the throughput is maximized? How much communication overhead is due to the network communication protocol layer(s)? How quickly will a small (< 1 kbyte) control message arrive, and which network and protocol are best for this purpose? 
For a paper fully describing NetPIPE and sample investigation of network performance issues using NetPIPE, see http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/netpipe/paper/full.html.

This is a developing project to monitor a large assortment of UPS hardware. Many models have ports on the back to allow other devices to check their status.  If it gives basic information about the power and battery status, it can probably be supported without too much difficulty.  More advanced features on the higher-end models are also supported to allow tracking of values over time such as temperature and voltage. 
Network communications are used so that multiple systems can monitor a single physical UPS and shut down together if necessary without any special "sharing hardware" on the UPS itself. Detailed information about supported hardware can be found in /usr/share/doc/packages/smartups/README

These objects range from low level data-centered objects such as Sphere,  Camera, Material, Light, and Group, to high level application-level objects such as Walkthrough  Viewer  and Material  Editor.   The  foundation concept in Inventor is the "scene database" which defines the objects to be  used in an application.  When using Inventor, a programmer cre­ ates, edits, and composes these objects into  hierarchical 3d  scene graphs (i.e., database).  A variety of fundamen­ tal application tasks such as  rendering,  picking,  event handling, and file reading/writing are built-in operations of all objects in the database  and  thus  are  simple  to invoke.

Label:         Open Type Organizer
Description:
he 'Open Type Organizer' project provides programs to list and modify tables in OpenType font files, specifically, their 'name' and 'cmap' tables.  It can be used to translate 'name' and 'cmap' of OpenType font in locale encodings to Unicode encoding so the font file can be used in an environment which does not understand locale encodings.  The translated tables are added to the font while keeping the original tables intact. 
Do you have a True Type font which does not work with Xft (e.g. with KDE and Antialiasing)? Chances are, the font doesn't have a Unicode 'cmap'!  Open Type Organizer (oTo) will help to solve the problem.  It will add Unicode 'name' and Unicode 'cmap' tables by translating the original ones.  Your favorite ttf font can really work for you now.

This package enables the usage of PCMCIA hardware with Linux. The handling and configuration is described in the manual in chapter 11. More detailed documentation can be found under /usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/ and in some included manpages. (See "rpm -ql pcmcia | grep man" after installation.) 
The PCMCIA modules strongly depend on the running kernel. Therefore the modules are packed with the kernel in the packages k_*.rpm. If you compile your own kernel you should recompile the pcmcia package as well. For this install the pcmcia source package from the zq series. After rebooting with the new kernel just call rpm -ba /usr/src/packages/SPEC/pcmcia.spec and install the new packages. 
The program cardinfo is placed in the package pcmcia-cardinfo. 
Note that you need this package even if you use the intergrated pcmcia support of kernel 2.4. Only Cardbus cards are managed from the kernels hotplug system. 
Supported hardware: Most modern PCMCIA chipsets and cards are supported. A list of supported chipsets can be found in the PCMCIA-HOWTO under /usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/. In the same directory you can find a file SUPPORTED.CARDS. We have integrated additional drivers in the PCMCIA package. See the README.<driver> files for documentation. README.contrib contains a short summary of these additional drivers.

Filename:      perl-Apache-Filter.spm
Label:         Alter the output of previous handlers
Description:
In basic operation, each of the handlers Filter1, Filter2, and Filter3 will make a call to $r->filter_input(), which will return a filehandle.  For Filter1, the filehandle points to the requested file. For Filter2, the filehandle contains whatever Filter1 wrote to STDOUT. For Filter3, it contains whatever Filter3 wrote to STDOUT. The output of Filter3 goes directly to the browser. 

Note that the modules Filter1, Filter2, and Filter3 are listed in forward order, in contrast to the reverse-order listing of Apache::OutputChain. 

When you've got this module, you can use the same handler both as a stand-alone handler, and as an element in a chain. Just make sure that whenever you're chaining, all the handlers in the chain are "Filter- aware," i.e. they each call $r->filter_register() exactly once, before they start printing to STDOUT. There should be almost no overhead for doing this when there's only one element in the chain.

It stores key/language/values triplets. Using the Accept- Language: field sent by the web-client, it can pick the best fit language for that specific client.  It's usage is transparent and should prove to be quite convenient (and hopefully, efficient).  The method used to store/fetch information is now completely modular and will allow easy creation of new storage methods thru a simple API.

Filename:      perl-Date-Calc.spm
Label:         Perl Date-Calc Module
Description:
This package consists of a C library and a Perl module (which uses the C library, internally) for all kinds of date calculations based on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in all western countries today), thereby complying with all relevant norms and standards: ISO/R 2015-1971, DIN 1355 and, to some extent, ISO 8601 (where applicable). 
(See also http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/Date-Calc/DIN1355/ for a scan of part of the "DIN 1355" document (in German)). 
The module of course handles year numbers of 2000 and above correctly ("Year 2000" or "Y2K" compliance) -- actually all year numbers from 1 to the largest positive integer representable on your system (which is at least 32767) can be dealt with. 
Note that this package EXTRAPOLATES the Gregorian calendar BACK until the year 1 A.D. -- even though the Gregorian calendar was only adopted in 1582 by most (not all) European countries, in obedience to the corresponding decree of catholic pope Gregor I in that year. 
Some (mainly protestant) countries continued to use the Julian calendar (used until then) until as late as the beginning of the 20th century. 
Finally, note that this package is not intended to do everything you could ever imagine automagically for you; it is rather intended to serve as a toolbox (in the best of UNIX spirit and traditions) which should, however, always get you where you want to go.

Description:
The majority of the web pages of the internet today are much larger than they need to be.  The reason for this is that HTML tends to be stored in a human readable format, with indenting, newlines and comments. 

However, all of these comments, whitespace etc. are ignored by the browser, and needlessly lengthen download times. 

Second, many people are using WYSIWYG HTML editors these days. This makes creating content easy.  However these editors can cause a number of compatibility problems by tying themselves to a particular browser or operating system.

##
Filename:      perl-HTML-SimpleParse.spm
Label:         a bare-bones HTML parser
Description:
This is the HTML::SimpleParse module.  It is a bare-bones HTML parser, similar to HTML::Parser, but with a couple important distinctions: 

First, HTML::Parser knows which tags can contain other tags, which start tags have corresponding end tags, which tags can exist only in the <HEAD> portion of the document, and so forth.  HTML::SimpleParse does not know any of these things.  It just finds tags and text in the HTML you give it, it does not care about the specific content of these tags (though it does distiguish between different _types_ of tags, such as comments, starting tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and so on). 

Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any attention to balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which pairs of tags are inside other pairs of tags. 

Because of these characteristics, you can make a very effective HTML filter by sub-classing HTML::SimpleParse.

A Unicode::String object represents a sequence of Unicode characters. The Unicode Standard is a fixed-width, uniform encoding scheme for written characters and text. This encoding treats alphabetic characters, ideographic characters, and symbols identically, which means that they can be used in any mixture and with equal facility.  Unicode is modeled on the ASCII character set, but uses a 16-bit encoding to support full multilingual text.

perl - Practical Extraction and Report Language 
Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on that information.  It's also a good language for many system management tasks.  The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). 
Some of the modules available on CPAN can be found in the "perl" series. 
Attention: due to security reasons we disabled the suid bit of /usr/bin/suidperl.  If you need this feature, please add the following line to /etc/permissions.local and run SuSEconfig.

The variable can be set to either "no", "yes", "masq", or one or more interface names, seperated by spaces. The firewall script inserts firewall rules that should not interfere with any other rules/rulesets and therefore is fully compatible with the SuSEfirewall, working "on top" of the SuSEfirewall rules. The script runs each time /etc/ppp/ip-up or /etc/ppp/down is called to catch up with the changes in the nameserver configuration as performed by the ppp subsystem. 
NOTE: some protocols will fail if the personal-firewall is active. Among these are ftp (PORT mode), irc (DCC mode, CTCP), quake, real-audio, real-video and others that open secondary connections or that use UDP datagrams.

- integration of active databases (alerts and triggers), conclusions including forward and backward chaining; 
- simplification of dbms code for restore after a crash. 
- provision of a design which concatenates the advantages of optical disks and workstations which consist of many compound processors and customer-specific VLSI chips; 
- avoidance of too many changes according to relational model. 
The query language for this system is SQL. This system offers you a wide range of additional features such as transparent history-system, embedding in your own C-routines, shell scripts and more.

The individual computers may be shared- or local-memory multiprocessors, vector supercomputers, specialized graphics engines, or scalar workstations, that may be interconnected by a variety of networks, such as ethernet, FDDI.  User programs written in C, C++ or Fortran access PVM through library routines. 
After installation you find in /usr/share/doc/packages/pvm/ the documentation as PostScript file pvm-book.ps.  Furthermore some examples are packed together in two tar archives.  Those archives should be extracted into your HOME directory which leads to ~/pvm3/examples/ or ~/pvm3/gexamples/ in your HOME directory.  The call `aimk all' (see manual page aimk(1)) e.g. in ~/pvm3/examples/ compiles the examples for the PVM system.

From the RELNOTES: 

[...] a validating namespace-aware XML parser in C. 

RXP was written by Richard Tobin at the Language Technology Group, Human Communication Research Centre, University of Edinburgh. 

RXP is distributed under the GNU Public Licence, which is in the file COPYING.  RXP may be made available under other licensing terms; contact M.Moens@ed.ac.uk for details. 

RXP is based on the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation of 10th February 1998 and the Namespaces recommendation of 14th January 1999.  Deviations from these recommendations should probably be considered as bugs. 

There is currently only minimal documentation.  There is a manual page for the rxp program, and a hastily-written file called "Manual" which describes the public functions and data structures.  The file "Threads" contains some notes about use in a threaded environment. [...] 

A simple application (called rxp) is provided that parses and writes XML data, optionally expanding entities, defaulting attributes, and translating to a different output encoding. 

There is an RXP web page at 
http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/rxp.html

In practice, this means that you can redirect disks and printers to Unix disks and printers from LAN Manager clients, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 clients, Windows'95 clients, Windows NT clients and OS/2 clients. There is also a Unix client program supplied as part of the suite which allows Unix users to use an ftp-like interface to access filespace and printers on any other SMB server. 
Samba includes the following programs (in summary): 
* smbd, the SMB server. This handles actual connections from clients. 
* nmbd, the Netbios name server, which helps clients locate servers. 
* smbclient, the Unix-hosted client program. 
* smbrun, a little 'glue' program to help the server run external programs. 
* testprns, a program to test server access to printers. 
* testparm, a program to test the Samba configuration file for correctness. 
* smb.conf, the Samba configuration file. 
* smbprint, a sample script to allow a Unix host to use smbclient to print to an SMB server. 
The suite is supplied with full source and is GPLed. 
This package expects its config file under /etc/samba/smb.conf.

The scheme management allows you to handle different configurations for your computer. A single configuration can be activated when needed. Basically the scheme management is made for the needs of mobile computers. The tool is under development and supports, therefore, only the configuration of network, mail, X, printer, and changing hardware (in docking units), but it is full functional. We are interested for your needs in this area. If you have suggestions or bug reports, please contact zoz@suse.de.

Description:
Scid can perform many different searches, such as for particular players, a certain opening position, material searches, and pattern searches such as isolated pawns. It is very fast, because it uses its own efficient format, but it can convert games to and from PGN, the standard format for chess game files. 
Scid can use a chess engine such as Crafty to analyze games and also has a "tree" mode where it automatically shows all moves played from the current position, their opening codes, success rates, etc.

It is best used for jobs with simple configurations.  I use it for building test and demonstration programs as well as SciTE and Scintilla themselves. 
Scintilla is a free source code editing component. As well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla includes features especially useful when editing and debugging source code. These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion, and call tips. The selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and background colors, and multiple fonts. It comes with complete source code and may be used in any free project or commercial product.

Filename:      scsh.spm
Label:         The Scheme Shell
Description:
Scsh is a broad-spectrum systems-programming environment for Unix embedded in R4RS Scheme. 

Scsh has a high-level process notation for doing shell-script-like tasks: running programs, establishing pipelines, and I/O redirection. For example, the shell pipeline 

gunzip < paper.tex.gz | detex | spell | lpr -Ppulp & 

would be written in scsh as 

(& (| (gunzip) (detex) (spell) (lpr -Ppulp))	; Background a pipeline (< paper.tex.gz))				; with this redirection 

Scsh embeds this process notation within a full Scheme implementation. The process notation is realized as a set of macro definitions and is carefully designed to allow full integration with standard Scheme code. Scsh isn't Scheme-like, it is Scheme.

* scsiformat: A low-level formatting tool for SCSI disks. 
* scsidev: If your SCSI config changes from time to time, for example, because you have external devices which are not always switched on or connected, the kernel's mapping to the device nodes is not always the way you would expect it. This program creates a mapping which remains unchanged in most of these cases. 
* rescan-scsi-bus.sh: Script that scans the SCSI bus and dynamically adds and, optionally, removes devices. 
* sg_utils: A collection of small useful tools based on the sg interface that give info on the SCSI bus, copy data,... 
Warning: Some of these tools access the internals of your system and misuse of them may render your system inoperational.

Filename:      scwm.spm
Label:         Scheme-Configurable Window Manager
Description:
From the Scwm home page (/usr/share/doc/packages/scwm/scwmrc/): 

Scwm is the Scheme-Configurable Window Manager. It is a window manager with a powerful configuration language based on Guile Scheme. Scwm has a number of advanced features, many implemented in the configuration language itself. It is in very active development currently, and continues to improve. 

Scwm was originally based on fvwm2 code. It is rapidly evolving in the internals, but we are striving to maintain compatibility on various levels. It now has a strict superset of fvwm2 features. Even fvwm2 modules may be executed through an adapter written in the configuration language. 

Features 
======== 

Scwm has a number of useful features, some of which are rarely seen in a window manager. Here are some highlights: 
- Full programmability using Guile Scheme. 
- Support for GUI scripting using guile-gtk (experimental quality). 
- Optional constraint-based window-layout system (new in v0.9). See README-constraints for information on getting started. 
- Fully documented the C-level primitives. 
- Much-improved documentation browsing capabilities from Emacs. 
- Multiple decoration styles, including mwm, fvwm and win95 so far. 
- Everything that can be configured can be changed on the fly at runtime. 
- A powerful external control protocol. The scwmexec program can be used to execute any window manager. 
- command at any time; scwmrepl gives you an interactive session with the window manager. 
- An emacs interaction mode: edit your .scwmrc in emacs, and evaluate the results immediately, without restarting. 
- Support for fvwm2 modules. 
- Multiple disjoint virtual desktops. 
- Animated move and windowshade operations. 
- Synthetic events (allowing you to bind keystrokes or mouse operations to sequences of clicks and keyboard commands). 
- Ability to load nearly any image type. 
- Timer hooks, input hooks, new window hooks. 
- Direct support for /etc/X11/wmconfig/ under RedHat GNU/Linux 5.x. 
- XLock menu that queries xlock for the available modes automatically. 

The code is fairly portable. It is known to work at least on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and Irix. 

Scwm comes with a number of example scwmrc files in the sample.scwmrc directory (/usr/share/doc/packages/scwm/scwmrc/) which demonstrate many of the useful features.

Using the built-in script language, automatic login, uploading, and downloading is no longer a problem. 

Attention : For security reasons, we had to remove the sgid bit for the uucp group. All users that should be able to use seyon must be added to the group uucp (e.g., with YaST). 
If there are only "trusted users" in your system and you want to ensure that seyon is usable for all of them, add the following line to /etc/permissions.local and run SuSEconfig 
/usr/X11R6/bin/seyon                   root.uucp        2755 


The actual transmission is provided by several programs like sz/rz/kermit. Since we are not allowed to supply kermit with our distribution, you have to get it yourself from the Internet (ftp: kermit.columbia.edu). Look at the various sites at sunsite.unc.edu or any server which mirrors sunsite (ftp.gwdg.de under /pub/Linux/X11/xapps/comm or /pub/Linux/apps/comm). You have to configure ~/.seyon/protocol to use it.

Description:
GNU Smalltalk is an implementation which is almost Smalltalk-80 conform (\tm ParkPlace Systems) as described in Adele Goldberg and David Robson's book 'Smalltalk-80: the Language and its Implementations', which will be referred to as the 'Blue Book'. 
Smalltalk is an object oriented programming language, meaning that the programmer not only has to keep the data in his head but the operations which can be applied to this object. The ability of an object of keeping not only track of the data but also to those operations that are connected to itself are inseparable glued together. The amount of actions that can be performed by the object is precisely defined by the amount of operations of this special object (called methods in Smalltalk). You can't 'see' the contents of an object from outside the object. Seen from the outside an object is a black box which has some particular operations and states, but that's about all you know. 
In Smalltalk everything is an object. This includes variables, executable procedures (methods) and stack frames (context of invoked methods or context of a block). Every object is an instance of a class. You can see a class as a datatype and its incorporated functions. An instance is a particular variable of this datatype. 
If you want to perform an operation on one of these objects you have to send it a message and the object reacts by performing the correspondent action. To print something, e.g., you could send the message like this: 
someObject print 
The message you send is indeed the name of a method (procedure) which should be carried out. If you send a message to an object Smalltalk tries to find out the method that has been defined for this kind of object. First it starts looking at the objects class. If there is no such class it bothers the parent class, in the grandfather class etc.. At the top of this class-construction there is a class called Object which has no ancestors.  If Smalltalk couldn't find a method until then it produces an error code. 
For a complete explanation of Smalltalk there is a very nice tutorial by Andy Valencia: try the command   info '(gst)Tutorial' . 
Additionally the X Smalltalk interface and object browser 'blox' (xgst) is included.  Besides blox, GNU Smalltalk has two other modules which may be compiled in, tcp and gdbm.  All three available modules are compiled to the executable named gst_all; if you need another combination of modules, recompile the source (or write to feedback@suse.de). 
Happy small talking!

Label:         The "Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator"
Description:
Nice simulator of neural networks which has been developed at the University of Stuttgart. All parameters are presented in individual windows. To really use this program, a fundamental background in neural networks is required. 
SNNS (Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator) is a software simulator for neural networks on Unix workstations developed at the University of Stuttgart. The aim of the project is the development of an flexible simulation interface for research and use of neural networks. 
SNNS consists mainly of two parts: 
o simulator kernel written in C 
o GUI under X11 
The simulator kernel works with the internal network-data structures of the neural network and performs all operations by learning or doing. It can also be used separately as a C program embedded in applications. It supports multiple network topologies and, almost like RCS, supports the sites concept. SNNS can be extended by the individual user with user-specific activation functions, output functions, site-functions, and learning procedures which can easily be connected as simple C programs with the simulation kernel. 
At the moment of this writing, the following algorithms are supported: 
o back propagation 
o vanilla (online) BP 
o BP with Momentum Term and Flat Spot Elimination 
o Batch BP 
o Time Delay BP 
o Counter propagation 
o Quick prop 
o Back percolation 1 
o Generalized radial-base-functions (RBF) 
o RProp 
o ART 1 
o ART 2 
o ARTMAP 
o Cascade Correlation 
o Return Cascade Correlation 
o Dynamic LVQ 
o Back propagation through time (for recursive networks) 
o Batch Back propagation through time (for recursive networks) 
o Quick propagation through time 	"    "        " 
o Kohonen Feature Maps 
The GUI XGUI based on the kernel presents 1/2/3-dimensional views of the neural network and controls the kernel during the run time of the simulation. Additionally, the 2D user-interface provides an integrated network-editor, which can be used to design, manipulate, and present neural networks. 
A complete user manual can be found in the package snnsdoc. 
The current version of SNNS can be obtained from ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de /pub/SNNS

Sqsh is much more than a nice prompt (a la 'dsql', from David B. Joyner). It is intended to provide much of the functionality provided by a good shell, such as variables, aliasing, redirection, pipes, backgrounding, job control, history, command substitution, and dynamic configuration. Also, as a by-product of the design, it is remarkably easy to extend and add functionality.

RPM created for beta testing phase! Backup your data before using! Generally, the safest use of this program is to run it as a regular user with access to the testing physical disk (like /dev/hdc*) in /dev. The partition table will not be reread automatically if modifications by Surprise "confirm" were made by a regular user. All debug messages (currently turned on during compilation) are sent to stderr (e.g., "surprisecurses 2>/tmp/surlog" or "surprisecurses 2>/dev/null"). 
You should use either "surprisecmdline" client or more comfortable "surprisecurses" one. These clients are designed for further use. Just for testing purposes, a YaST2-destined "dummy" module is provided, "testdummy" client (/usr/surprise/tests/testdummy). Read its documentation file "testdummy.txt". 
The whole package documentation is installed in /usr/share/doc/packages/surprise in HTML format.

It supports: 

* integrated phone book 
* sending faxes directly from the phone book 
* setting up job parameters before sending a job and during processing of the job in the job queue 
* removing jobs from the job queue 
* direct viewing of received faxes (needs an external tiffg3 viewer or converter. For Linux and UNIX, the converting is done by fax2ps from libtiff and viewing by ghostview or gv automatically by a script included with this package) 
* creating of serial fax lists out of the phone book entries 
* automatic cover page generation (not very fast) 
* auto-spooling (important for Windows users) This program is also running on WINDOWS and hopefully all the other platforms that support Java by the JDK from Sun. It has been tested on WindowsNT 4.0 and it seems to run. 
* password prompting if the administrator of the fax server wants the users to access the server via password 
* JDBC Support

For KDE, mwm, ctwm, and icewm, there is only support for keeping the menus up to date since these are very different from the other window managers, like fvwm. 

The icons used in the fvwm2 / fvwm95 menus are taken from the package 3dpixms which themselves are generated from the 3dpixm package.

However, this is only scratching the surface of what SWIG can do--some of its more advanced features include automatic documentation generation, module and library management, extensive customization options, and more.

Label:         The base system of teTeX
Description:
After installing teTeX and the package te_latex, find a large selection of documentation for TeX, LaTeX, and various layout styles under /usr/share/texmf/doc. 
TeX (pronounced tech) is an interpreter for text formatting and was developed by Donald E. Knuth.  It works with control and macro commands on a text file. Working with TeX is similar to typesetting methods. LaTeX or better LaTeX2e is a complex macro package which  removes the cryptical TeX interface and does most of the work for the user. 
TeX uses special fonts produced by the MetaFont program. Various printer drivers and an X11 viewer is also included in this package. The teTeX package is based on the standard  TeX package of Karl Berry which makes configuration much easier. It's also possible to use PostScript fonts. A real PostScript printer is required however. If the ghostscript (gs) package is installed, all drivers for printing and viewing can use these fonts. Note,  however, that the fonts included in the ghostscript package are not identical to Adobe's PostScript fonts. The copyright  prohibits us from including them on the CD. 
Besides these features, there are the programs MakeIndex (for producing indexes), BibTeX (for literature data-processing), and the script xtexsh (requires tcl/tk). 
Note the differences between LaTeX2.09 and LaTeX2e. LaTeX2e can process original LaTeX2.09 text, but style files that require LaTeX2.09 internal macros may not work correctly.  Under /usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/base/, find the documentation for LaTeX2e.  New users should review the documentation stored there. 
The teTeX package from Thomas Esser includes a full texmf tree, many programs (tex, dvips, ...), shell scripts configuration, and a big collection of documentations. This package is simply configured by the script texconfig and has multilanguage options. 
Do NOT install this package together with ntex! 
teTeX is NOT an upgrade or update for the ntex package!!

When editing HTML it's easy to make mistakes. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a simple way to fix these mistakes automatically and tidy up sloppy editing into nicely layed out markup? Well now there is! Dave Raggett's HTML TIDY is a free utility for doing just that. It also works great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized HTML editors and conversion tools, and can help you identify where you need to pay further attention on making your pages more accessible to people with disabilities. 

Tidy is able to fix up a wide range of problems and to bring to your attention things that you need to work on yourself. Each item found is listed with the line number and column so that you can see where the problem lies in your markup. Tidy won't generate a cleaned up version when there are problems that it can't be sure of how to handle. These are logged as "errors" rather than "warnings". 

Tidy features in a recent article on XHTML by webreview.com.

TkDesk is a graphical desktop and file manager for UNIX (especially Linux) and the X Window System.  Compared with other file managers available, it offers the most complete set of file operations and services, plus gives the user the ability to configure most aspects of TkDesk in a powerful way.  The reason for this is the use of Tcl/Tk as the configuration and (for the greatest part of TkDesk) implementation language.  TkDesk has been influenced by various other systems and file managers: NeXT, for laying out the file browser windows, Apple Finder, for the idea of file annotations and, (shock horror), Windows 95, for some other (of course minor and unimportant ;-)) inspirations. 
This is a brief overview of the most prominent features of TkDesk: 
o  Arbitrary number of automatically refreshed file browsers and file list windows o  Configurable file-specific pop-up menus o  Drag and drop o  Files and directories may also be dropped onto the root window o  Configurable application bar, with several displays and cascadable pop-up menus for each button. Files can also be dropped here. o  History of visited directories, opened files, executed commands, and others, which is automatically saved to disk o  Find files through their annotation, name, contents, size, or age o  Trash can for safe deletion of files and directories o  Calculation of disk usage for directory hierarchies o  All file operations (find, copy, disk usage, etc.) are carried out in the background o  Traversal of directory hierarchies through recursive cascaded menus o  Bookmarks, create menu entries for often used files and directories o  Comprehensive hypertext online help o  Built-in multibuffer and undo-capable editor o  Close coupling with Netscape and XEmacs o  Sound support o  Powerful configuration of nearly all aspect of TkDesk through Tcl/Tk, this also allows the Tcl-literate to extend TkDesk in arbitrary ways o  Free of charge!

Extensive command-line options control which, if any, of these occur. 
Gifview, a companion program requiring X11, displays GIF images and animations on an X display. It can display multi-frame GIFs either as slideshows, displaying one frame at a time, or as real-time animations.

Filename:      web2ldap.spm
Label:         WEB based LDAP-Client
Description:
Directory services like LDAP are suitable for holding a lot of organizational information in a standarized database scheme. LDAP is very handy for, e.g., providing centralized addressbooks for the users of an organization. Widely used mail client software like Netscape Messenger or Outlook already have built-in support for accessing directory services through LDAP for retrieving personal data like mail addresses or certificate data. 
However, some situations arise in which there is a strong need for: 
- a robust and flexible LDAP client software which provides the ability to add and modify LDAP entries. - access to the directory without having LDAP-capable client software (e.g., via WWW). - a secure LDAP client with clean login behavior. - hiding the LDAP service behind a firewall. - encryption for LDAP access over unsecure networks. 
This is why web2ldap was developed. It aims to be a full-featured LDAPv2+ client.  See web2ldap pages on http://web2ldap.de/

WorkBone uses the number block as a control panel to enable jumping from track to track, play CDs, stop, etc. Furthermore, the actual playing time is permanently actualized and displayed. 
WorkBone works with most CD-ROM drives. But there still are some NEC CD-ROMs that don't work because they use non-standardized audio commands which result in a malfunction of WorkBone. 
WorkBone  expects  to find the device: /dev/cdrom . If you don't have this device, change to /dev and soft link  your current CD-ROM device to 'cdrom'.

Label:         Init script package for the Canna compatible WXG Japanese input server
Description:
This package contains an init script for the Japanese Input server WXG. It does *not* contain the server itself. 

WXG is a Kana-Kanji conversion server using the Canna communication protocol. WXG is compatible to NEC's Kana-Kanji conversion server &quot;Canna&quot; and can therefore be talk to Canna clients like kinput2, canuum, Mule, and XEmacs. It can be used as a direct replacement for Canna. 

However, WXG uses the same port as Canna and can therefore not run concurrently with Canna, you can run either WXG or Canna, not both at the same time. 

To get more information about the WXG input server, please have a look at http://www.ekotoba.com. If you agree to the license you can download the WXG server from that page.

Filename:      x3270.spm
Label:         Family of IBM 3270 terminal emulators
Description:
This package contains a family of 3270 mainframe terminal emulators: 
* terminal emulators for interactive use x3270  X Window System c3270  curses based * terminal emulators for scripted use s3270    see x3270-script man page tcl3270  tcl based * printer emulator pr3287 
x3270 is an IBM 3270 terminal emulator for the X Window System.  x3270 runs over a TELNET connection (with or without TN3270E) and emulates either an IBM 3279 (color) or 3278 (monochrome).  It supports APL2 characters, IND$FILE file transfer, NVT mode, a pop-up keypad for 3270-specific keys, alternative keymaps, 3287 printer sessions, a scrollbar and has extensive debugging and scripting facilities. 
c3270 is the curses-based version of x3270.  It runs on any dumb terminal (e.g. xterm, console), and supports (almost) all of the features of x3270.  c3270 scripts are compatible with x3270 scripts, and the subset of command-line options and resource definitions are compatible as well. 
s3270 is a scripting-only version of x3270.  This program is intended primarily for writing "screen-scraping" applications, e.g., a CGI back-end script that retrieves database information from a mainframe. 
tcl3270 is a Tcl-based 3270 scripting engine.  It lets you write Tcl scripts that manipulate 3270 sessions, and is quite a bit easier to set up and use than s3270. 
pr3287 is the printer companion for the tools above, and allows printer output from a 3270 session to be directed to a Unix printer queue.

Essentially, this is a proof by induction that a computer is more powerful than an abacus, since a computer program can contain an abacus. (But then again, you can simulate a computer within a computer, so what does that show). Actually, with a real abacus, one can move more than one row at a time with 10 fingers.  But on the other hand, a real abacus does not have the current sum displayed as an integer.

Filename:      xfsdump.spm
Label:         Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
Description:
The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore, and a number of other utilities for administering XFS file systems. 

xfsdump examines files in a file system, determines which need to be backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or other storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the dump of an XFS file system and also knows how to backup XFS extended attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can thus be transferred between Linux machines of different architectures and also between IRIX machines. 

xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump.  It can restore a full backup of a file system.  Subsequent incremental backups can then be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

This feature is a compile-time option and requires the existence of the compface library routines, which are NOT supplied with the xmail sources.    X-Face headers are compressed bitmap images, typically of the face of the person owning such a header.  The compressed header contains only printable characters, which allows it to be included in a mail message.  The USENIX FaceSaver project is typically the source for these bitmaps, which are compressed into X-Face header format using the compface software tools written and distributed by James Ashton <jaa@cs.su.oz.au>.  The compface library is also provided with the distribution of the faces software, written by Rich Burridge, and is available by email from his archive server <rb-archive-server@Aus.Sun.COM>.

Description:
XMPI is an X/Motif based graphical user interface for running, debugging and visualizing MPI programs. Extensive MPI information is extracted from a running application on demand or from a cumulative log of communication. Both sources are tightly integrated with an application overview window and any number of single process focus windows. 
XMPI can acquire and display extensive detail on an application's MPI communication, including the following: o process synchronization status: running, system, or blocked o message queue contents o source, destination, root ranks o MPI function name o communicator o data type o message count o tag The above information is acquired from on-demand snapshots of application status using debugging hooks in the MPI implementation or from a trace log of communication activity. 
XMPI is a great tool for teaching MPI in a hands-on setting.  Students run example code and can see and verify each MPI operation.  XMPI has an application "wizard" to help assemble programs and assign processors to MIMD and SPMD applications.  Furthermore, it is not tedious to generate, acquire, and display information.  A typical development cycle begins by assembling an application and continues in the following manner. o press the snapshot button to see what's going on now o pop-up focus windows for a few interesting processes o press the snapshot button a few (or a few dozen!) more times o see the application completed, hung, deadlocked, etc... o press the trace button once and the timeline window is displayed o review the previous execution with trace log snapshots o make application changes and press the rerun button No recompiles or special libraries are required to snapshot the application or obtain a trace log.

Filename:      xntp.spm
Label:         Network Time Protocol daemon (version 4)
Description:
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides client accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs and up to a few tens of milliseconds on WANs relative to a primary server synchronized to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) via a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example. Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and diverse network paths, to achieve high accuracy and reliability. Some configurations include cryptographic authentication to prevent accidental or malicious protocol attacks. 
ntpd is an operating system daemon which sets and maintains the system time-of-day synchronized with Internet standard time servers. ntpd is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. ntpd does most computations in 64-bit floating point arithmetic and does relatively clumsy 64-bit fixed point operations only when necessary to preserve the ultimate precision, about 232 picoseconds. While the ultimate precision is not achievable with ordinary workstations and networks of today, it may be required with future nanosecond CPU clocks and gigabit LANs. 
The daemon can operate in any of several modes, including symmetrical active/passive, client/server broadcast/multicast, and manycast. A broadcast/multicast or manycast client can discover remote servers, compute server-client propagation delay correction factors, and configure itself automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without specifying configuration details specific to the local environment. 
Ordinarily, ntpd reads the ntp.conf configuration file at start-up time to determine the synchronization sources and operating modes. It is also possible to specify a working, although limited, configuration entirely on the command line, obviating the need for a configuration file. This may be particularly appropriate when the local host is to be configured as a broadcast/multicast client or manycast client, with all peers being determined by listening to broadcasts at run time. 
Various internal ntpd variables can be displayed and configuration options altered while the daemon is running using the ntpq and ntpdc utility programs.

Description:
A small program -- similar to xsysinfo -- which is mostly configurable using resources via ~/.Xresources. Shows actual CPU, swap, memory, active interrupts, and, if desired, netpacket statistics. If you want to get information about 'network traffic', you still have to call ipfwadm (included in the same package) to activate this as root. This might look like: 
/sbin/ipfwadm -A -a -P all -S <own IP-address> -D 0/0 
/sbin/ipfwadm -A -a -P all -S 0/0 -D <own IP-address> 
Please have a look at /usr/share/doc/packages/xosview/README.linux. 
For showing shared pages, the module 
memstat.o 
has to be loaded with insmod.  The source of the module is located in /usr/share/doc/packages/xosview/memstat/. The installation is necessary only after an upgrade of the kernel.

No information is lost. The telephone book function is very useful for frequently used talk partners. The connection parameter will show permanently in the status line under the buttonstrip. Open a second or third connection without great difficulty by choosing "File->New XTalk" from the menu. 
Very useful is the built-in file transfer function. It is based on an internal protocol and therefore only enabled if the partner also runs an XTalk client. While establishing the connection, XTalk checks whether there is an XTalk client running on the other end. If this is the case, the transfer menu is automatically enabled.

Label:         zsh shell
Description:
Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell), which, of the standard shells, most resembles the Korn shell (ksh), although it is not completely compatible. It includes enhancements of many types, notably in the command-line editor, options for customizing its behavior, file name globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and extra features drawn from tcsh (another `custom' shell). Especially the command line completion is what the zsh is known for.
